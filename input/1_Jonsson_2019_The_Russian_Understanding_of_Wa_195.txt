, armed conflict was just one of the tools in war, and the state of war preceded its application. This represents a division whereby Makhonin saw war as the most intense form of fighting (and potentially anachronistic) and social conflict as the relevant legitimizing factor, while the other notion of war saw it as a condition that allows a variety of means, including (but not limited to) armed violence.
Indeed, more theorists started to argue against the concept of war as solely defined by armed violence. In consequence, there was growing agreement that the changing understanding of war was making the dichotomy between war and peace anachronistic. This is, for instance, plainly stated by Pavel Antonovich (chair of electronic warfare in the Russian Combined-Arms Academy), who argued that "dividing lines between war and peace can be eroded conveniently in cyberspace. Damage (whatever its nature) can actually be done to an adversary without overstepping formally the line between war and peace" (Antonovich 2011, 37) . Yuri Starodubtstev, Vladmir Bukharin, and Sergei Semyonov contended similarly in their article "Warfare in the Technosphere" that a distinguishing feature for this type of warfare is that "war can be conducted on any scale without declaring it as a legal fact" (Starodubtstev, Bukharin, and Semyonov 2012, 53) .
