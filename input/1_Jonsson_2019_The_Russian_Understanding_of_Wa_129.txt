 were in the fourth generation of warfare, just like Russia's, and were easily defeated with superior C 4 ISR and precision-guided missiles and a small land force (Slipchenko 2005, 20) . Thus, it was seen as a break from earlier wars of a close-contact nature (Slipchenko 2005, 18) . The fifth generation of war (nuclear war) was also seen to be of a noncontact nature. However, since nuclear weapons were not considered usable and there has been no nuclear war, the Gulf War was the first prototype of a contactless war. Rather, Slipchenko saw the Kosovo War of 1998-99 in the former Yugoslavia as the first real noncontact, remote war of the future (Slipchenko 2005, 19 ). In the first six weeks of the conflict, he stated, "1,500 high precision cruise missiles were used, launched from very far away: Not one aircraft or ship entered Yugoslavia's AAD [antiaircraft defense] impact zone" (Slipchenko 2005, 19) . This meant that there was no theater of combat, and Slipchenko suggested using the term "theatre of war" (Slipchenko 2005, 20) . After this initial period of the war, the United States shifted to fourth-generation warfare by deploying regular troops.
