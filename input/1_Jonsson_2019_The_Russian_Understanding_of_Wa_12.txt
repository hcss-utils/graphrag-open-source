 unequivocal authoritative statement that war is no longer defined solely by armed violence or the threat thereof. However, this should not be expected, and such a declaration would have significant consequences. First, the concept of armed attack and armed violence is the basis of international law as well as the Russian federal law On Defense, which regulates the use of the armed forces. Such recognition would, given the Russian leadership's perception of these means as ongoing, mean that Russia now would be in a state of war.
This argument has direct implications for handling the conflict with Russia-something the West often struggles with. One example is how the US and EU sanctions on Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine were seen in the West as a way to avoid escalation, whereas the Russian leadership claimed they were a form of warfare to provoke regime change (Reuters 2014) . This emphasizes the difficulties that the West has with handling escalation with Russia. Measures such as sanctions are meant to signal that Russian actions are unacceptable, but the West also tends to think that they avoid escalation. However, they are often contrarily seen by the Russian leadership as escalation, although by nonmilitary means. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, "Russia believes itself to be in a war with the West, albeit, for now, a non-military one" (Jonsson 2017a) . The inability to grasp the Russian leadership's understanding gives Western states a disadvantage both in negotiating potential solutions with Russia and deterring Russia,
