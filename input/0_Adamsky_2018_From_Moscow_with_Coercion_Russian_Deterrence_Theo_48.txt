 aims to make the adversary believe that victory is improbable, to demonstrate that the cost of initiating or continuing the conflict is very high, and to make it hard for the adversary to translate its operational means into political ends. 67 
Russian cross-domain coercion that links together nuclear, conventional and informational tools of strategic influence is the most recent evolution in the Russian art of strategy. What are the ramifications of this approach for policy and theory?
On the one hand, cross-domain coercion expands the continuum of options on the escalation ladder while minimising the scale of kinetic operations. As such, this approach seemingly increases strategic stability. By employing it, Russia can promote its interests without escalating to major war, mainly through shaping and manipulating the strategic behaviour of its adversaries using a repertoire of tools but without employing massive brute force. Even from a purely legalistic point of view, such a repertoire of coercive actions may fall short of qualifying as an act of war. Concern about the cascading effects in the cyber realm may also contribute to a higher self-restraint. On the other hand, a critical examination of Moscow's efforts to deter and compel may take theoretical-conceptual issue with several of its aspects that seem destabilising. The findings suggest that these risks undermining strategic stability seem to emanate from the conceptual challenges that Russian strategists have not yet elaborated on, or overlooked in the nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) realms. Three challenges loom large.
The first challenge relates to coercive signalling. D
