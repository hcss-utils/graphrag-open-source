 published a study of armed confrontation in the twenty-first century, which they saw consisted of the following major novelties: broader use of weapons based on new technologies (bio-and nanotechnology, artificial intelligence, and new physical principles), increasing importance of space and information arenas, significantly reduced time frames in war, and more frequent use of special forces (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 20-21) . These trends would shape armed struggle to the extent that there is a possibility for a new kind of military confrontation of "unconventional wars (non-military forms of armed struggle) in which armed forces would conduct no operations or will play only a secondary role" (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) . This possibility, coupled with the destructiveness of nuclear weapons, would make large-scale wars less likely and unconventional wars a real possibility (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 26) . Furthermore, the dialectical development showed that the information component in a confrontation was increasing in importance (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 22) . Thus, they contended that it was not the form of violence that differentiated war from other activities but rather the intensity, length, and victory or defeat (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) . They even argued, drawing upon Sun Tzu, that military operations did not need to play a role
