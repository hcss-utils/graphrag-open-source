Hence, the political, social, and economic aims pursued in these wars are just and noble, while the armed violence is legitimate, justified" (Byely et al. 1972, 7) .

Thus, Soviet wars were legitimate because of what the Soviet Union was, not what it did. The moral thinking was based on a systematic character rather than particular actions.
