 I.4). In terms of the view of war, the 2000 Military Doctrine was less clear. It continued, like the 1993 doctrine, to explain war with armed conflict in parentheses. It noted that "the nature of modern wars and armed conflicts is determined by their military-political goals, the means of achieving these goals, and the scale of military operations" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.2).
In the paragraph describing modern wars, the doctrine reads that they affect all spheres of human activity and include "the extensive use of indirect, non-close quarter and other (including non-traditional) forms and methods of operation" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.3). Furthermore, there was a desire on both sides to "disrupt the system of state and military command and control" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.3). Modern wars also entailed "the use of highly efficient state-of-the-art systems of arms and military hardware (including those based on new physical principles), " and these means could be directed against targets across the territory of the warring parties (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.3). This can be seen as a new tone in the 2000 doctrine, which "reoriented priorities away from focus on small wars-type scenarios and towards the need for the creation of conventional forces with global reach" (Renz 2016b, 26)
