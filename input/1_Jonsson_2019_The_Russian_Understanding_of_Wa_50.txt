This book will use the perhaps suboptimal division between a Western debate and a Russian debate. Even though they are interacting, the key difference is the audience that they are addressing. For this reason, Russian theorists writing in the Western debate will be discussed there. This book will use all the terms "the West, " the "Arab Spring, " and the "color revolutions. " There are good reasons to doubt the suitability of all these terms, but since they are the most common terms used by Russian theorists and elites, they will be used in this book. The West generally refers to the United States and EU states together but can also simply mean the United States. This book will use the BGN/PCGN standard for Russian transliteration, although with a few exceptions. Names and words that are more commonly transliterated in other ways will be kept. Names such as "Vitaliy" and "Evgeniy" will be written as "Vitaly" and "Evgeny. " Moreover, war will be transliterated as voina rather than voyna, as it is the most common way of transliteration.
