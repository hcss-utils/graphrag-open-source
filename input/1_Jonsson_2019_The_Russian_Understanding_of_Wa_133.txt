Although a major innovation of Slipchenko's thought was his view that "information had become a destructive weapon just like a bayonet, bullet or projectile" (Slipchenko 2005, 33) , while considering the nature of war to be constant, he suggested adding a component that traditionally has been seen as nonviolent-information-as a destructive weapon. This is a potential contradiction, which he did not address explicitly. Slipchenko's work was still, long after his death, influential in the study of the future of war in Russia (Popov n.d.) .
