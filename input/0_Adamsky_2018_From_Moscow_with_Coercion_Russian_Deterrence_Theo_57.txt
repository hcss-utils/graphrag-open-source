 and its theory and practice are constantly evolving. In part, it may be because the West engages Moscow with only a vague understanding of the conceptual foundations and perception of Russian strategists. A recommendation for policymakers would be to initiate academic exchanges and second-track activities with Russian defence intellectuals to co-explore theoretical constructs of deterrence and to co-share indigenous perceptions on the subject. These conceptual-theoretical engagements on the nature of deterrence and cross-domain coercion may better educate Russian and Western policymakers about each other and reduce the likelihood of miscommunication and inadvertent escalation.
On a more theoretical note, the findings of this study urge the introduction of an idiosyncratic approach to exploring deterrence. The concept of tailoring deterrence strategy to the nature of the specific actor is already common wisdom. This study has shown that the understanding of deterrence strategies of different actors should be tailored as well. Emerging in a specific cultural context, deterrence conceptualisation is not universal and varies across strategic communities. This conclusion is in accord with earlier theoretical findings suggesting that 'theories of victory', operational art and coercion are social constructions, and their conceptualisation, consequently, has national characteristics and may differ from Western strategic theory. Although scholars should examine and measure an actor's modus operandi in a more idiosyncratic manner, they also naturally seek a sound parsimonious theory to deal with certain paradigmatic situations. For this task, an analytical framework of strategic culture and ideational explanations may be useful for clar
