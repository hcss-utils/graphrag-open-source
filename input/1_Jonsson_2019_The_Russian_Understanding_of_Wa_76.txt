 more intense and an even sharper form of confrontation between the two social systems" (quoted in Lider 1977, 265) . While maintaining Khrushchev's notion of war as avoidable, The Soviet Military Encyclopedia noted that it did not "signify the complete elimination of the possibility of war in the modern age. The nature of imperialism has not changed" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1993, 368) .
This underlies the Soviet view that the character of war depended on two things: economy and technology. Since the cause of war was economic in the Marxist-Leninist view and wars were caused by the ruling class to further their economic interests, the character of war depended on the economy. This was an idea originally proposed by Engels but maintained in Soviet thought (Peralta 2005, 96) . The Soviet Military Encyclopedia saw that the class relations defined the type of war, and they changed over time. The different eras included wars in a slaveholding society, in which the goal was to capture slaves; wars in a feudal society, where the goal was to seize land; wars in a capitalist society to acquire labor and access markets; and imperialist war, which "exacerbates all of the contradictions of capitalism to extremes and to an enormous degree intensifies the scale, the intensity, and the sphere of [sic] spread of wars" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1993, 365
