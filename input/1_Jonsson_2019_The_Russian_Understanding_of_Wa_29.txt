, gibridnaya voyna or gibridnaya metody" (Fridman 2018, 144) . In this sense, it becomes strange to fit the Russian military-theoretical tradition into a mostly unused concept that often refers to Western conduct when used.
Fridman's characterization of gibridnaya voina as solely being about nonmilitary and nonviolent means becomes too narrow a categorization in which to fit Russian military thought. It goes against Gerasimov's understanding, which can be seen in the article where he first mentioned hybrid methods; he also emphasizes that they relied on the use of military force and also included hidden military measures (Gerasimov 2016a ). Gerasimov has furthermore emphasized the importance of military means in almost every speech he has given. It thus becomes problematic to see gibridnaya voina as fully nonviolent when several Russian theorists discussing the phenomenon see violence as a distinguishing factor for what is considered gibridnaya voina. 4 It does, furthermore, not capture the broader trends in Russian military thought emphasizing both military and nonmilitary means.
The use of hybrid warfare has received pointed criticism for being a Western concept applied to Russian warfare without regard for the particular developments and traditions in Russia. Hybrid warfare (gibridnaya voina) in the Russian debate is a transliteration of the English term and is used when referencing Western thought (Giles 2016a
