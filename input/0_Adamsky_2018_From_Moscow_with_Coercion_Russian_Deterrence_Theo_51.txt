 possibly sometimes missing, part of the Russian approach.
This issue is linked to the evaluation challenge. How does one establish the effectiveness of one's deterrence programme on an opponent's decision-making? Available sources on the Russian professional discourse do not indicate that this procedure has been properly conceptualised and institutionalised either. Russian planners possibly assume that deterrence has been achieved when the operational plan has been fully executed, or take desired strategic behaviour by the opponent as confirmation of the plan's effectiveness. However, the evaluation of deterrence effectiveness and the requirement of a proven causal link, as opponents' behaviour may be a function of considerations unrelated to Moscow's actions, do not feature prominently in Russian publications. Lacking an established analytical mechanism to systematically assess how a coercion programme impacts the strategic calculus of the opponent, Moscow may take a correlation between its moves and an opponent's desirable behaviour for causality and interpret it as coercion success.
The current corpus of Russian literature does not explore thoroughly the subject of inadvertent escalation resulting from misinterpretation of signalling. This neglect may delude Russian leaders about the effectiveness of cross-domain coercion as an effective tool against a range of challenges and place them on the brink of an apocalypse without their knowing it. 70 According to Andrei Kokoshin, Russian military theory has insufficiently 69 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 17. 70 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 20. elaborated the questions pertaining to 'the art of strategic gesture'd
