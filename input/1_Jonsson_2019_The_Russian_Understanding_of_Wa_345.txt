The fundamental novelty in the understanding of the nature of war is, rather, information-psychological warfare. As the information arena is key for domestic and international power, information-psychological warfare is seen to be so effective that it can alter the consciousness of a country, eroding trust in public institutions and state policy to the degree that the citizens are prepared to revolt, creating color revolutions. In this way, information warfare is understood to be more effective than military force and able to reach strategic goals by itself. Several Russian theorists and elites see that information should be considered violent and that Russia is in an ongoing information war. Therefore, information warfare is seen to blur the boundaries between war and peace.
A crucial difference between the Russian and Western threat perceptions has been that the Russian view includes the content of information as a threat, whereas the Western view has, at least up until recently, focused on the free flow of information. It is because of this understanding of information warfare that the Russian threat perception has been notably broad, including everything from the influence on the mass consciousness and social and state stability to values of patriotism.
