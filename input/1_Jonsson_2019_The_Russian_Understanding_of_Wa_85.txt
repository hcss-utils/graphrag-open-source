They saw that Clausewitz denied the class nature of conflict and societies by assuming that politics represented the interest of society. In this way, they argued (like Lenin) that Clausewitz fallaciously understood politics only as foreign policy. On the contrary, war was foremost the continuation of domestic politics in the Marxist-Leninist view (Byely et al. 1972, 7-8) . Politics, rather than the relations between governments, the state apparatuses, and parties, was defined in their book Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii as the relations between classes (Byely et al. 1972, 8) . This relation in turn is defined by the mode of production that defined the classes, their relation to each other, and their interests (Byely et al. 1972, 8) . Concomitantly, war was then understood as the continuation of class politics by violent means. This became the central definition of war in the Soviet Union.
