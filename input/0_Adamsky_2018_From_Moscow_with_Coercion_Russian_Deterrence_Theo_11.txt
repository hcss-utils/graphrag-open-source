 essential for grasping the current wave of Russian theory and practice of coercion. This section examines both.
Since the Soviet collapse, two strategies of nuclear deterrence gradually emerged in Russia. The first, based on the threat of massive launch-on-warning and retaliation strikes, aimed at deterring nuclear aggression. The second, based on the threat of limited nuclear strikes, aimed at deterring conventional aggression and terminating a large-scale regional war. In most of the Russian references of that period, global deterrence rested on a strategic nuclear arsenal, and regional deterrence on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, although Russian thinking on this matter has never been coherent. The causal mechanism underlying this approach, defined in the West as 'regional nuclear deterrence' or 'deterrence and de-escalation doctrine', has not been officially elaborated. According to Adamsky, 'implicitly, it assumed that regional conventional wars would not involve values for which the adversary would tolerate the risk of even a single nuclear strike. Consequently, limited nuclear use would deter or terminate conventional hostilities, without escalation to a massive nuclear exchange'. 7 Scholars concur that scenario vignettes from the military exercises of that period demonstrated that when a counterattack by nonstrategic nuclear weapons restored the status quo; the adversary did not retaliate and terminated hostilities. 8 This period lasted until about 2009-10 and is relatively familiar to Western scholars. One of its main characteristics has been systemic incoherence. What political declarations, strategic
