 which revolves the development of military affairs, including the development of methods and forms of armed conflict" (Sushko and Tiuskhevich 1965, 128) .
Dialectical materialism and holism were the foundation for the scientific drive in Soviet military science. In 1917, Lenin decided that all science of war and society needed to be based on Marxism-Leninism (Thomas 2011, 77) . Against the backdrop of Lenin's disappointment when the older strategists did not rely on Marxist-Leninist methodology, Adamsky says that "the Bolsheviks were determined to produce unique, proletarian military science. They assumed that armed with the laws of dialectical materialism, the Red Army would possess a master key to military reality" (Adamsky 2010, 47) . Adamsky goes on to state that the major theorists-Mikhail Tukhachevsky, Boris Shaposhnikov, Mikhail Frunze, Aleksandr Svechin, and Trotsky-shared a conviction that "scientifically" developed military thought was a basic necessity (Adamsky 2010, 47) . However, a closer look reveals a contradiction here. Both Svechin and Trotsky held the view that military knowledge was more of an art than a science. Trotsky argued that "there is not and cannot be a science of war, in the precise meaning of that word. There is an art of war" (Trotsky
