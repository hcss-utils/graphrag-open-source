This neglect may delude Russian leaders about the effectiveness of cross-domain coercion as an effective tool against a range of challenges and place them on the brink of an apocalypse without their knowing it. 70 According to Andrei Kokoshin, Russian military theory has insufficiently 69 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 17. 70 Kristin Ven Bruusgaard, p. 20. elaborated the questions pertaining to 'the art of strategic gesture'demonstrations of nuclear and non-nuclear capabilities and resolve aimed at influencing an opponent's decision-making process.
