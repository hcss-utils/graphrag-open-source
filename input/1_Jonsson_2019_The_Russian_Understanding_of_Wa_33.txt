 the rubric 'NGW' . . . or [the] 'Gerasimov Doctrine'" (Adamsky 2015, 22) . Like Thornton, Adamsky placed information warfare at the center. He argued that "since, according to NGW, the main battlefield is consciousness, perception, and strategic calculus of the adversary, the main operational tool is information struggle, aimed at imposing one's strategic will on the other side. Perception, consequently, becomes a strategic center of gravity in the campaign" (Adamsky 2015, 26) .
He further argued that "this unique role of informational struggle is a fundamental difference between the Russian approach and the Western [hybrid warfare] model" (Adamsky 2015, 30) . 5 Adamsky saw that the Russian understanding and key focus of the information struggle had developed from three distinct bodies of knowledge, which rendered it unique. These were the Military-Technical Revolution (MTR) / Revolution in Military Affairs (RMA) (digital-technological), the active-measures tradition (cognitive-psychological), and the cybernetic tradition (Adamsky 2015, 27-28 ; see also Adamsky 2018) . Last, Adamsky argued that "it is difficult to overemphasize the role that Russian official doctrine attributes to the defensive and offensive aspects of informational struggle in modern conflicts" (Adamsky 2015, 26)
