 deterrence may include force demonstration, to prevent escalation, and even the limited use of force, as a radical measure for de-escalating hostilities. 36 Non-nuclear deterrence attributes a special role to targeting adversary's non-military assets and to activating non-military actors. Threats of financial and economic disruptions should be activated in conjunction with the military component of coercion, such as special operations forces and advanced conventional weapons. 37 Threatening the adversary's assets with massive precision non-nuclear strikes, coupled with the special forces' activities, signals resolve and capability and communicates the scale of unacceptable political, economic, social and technological damage that will be imposed unless adversary changes strategic behaviour. According to Gerasimov, this 'intimidation by force', as an asymmetrical-indirect method of NGW, combines political isolation, economic sanctions, blockades, the exploitation of internal opposition, interventions under the peacemakinghumanitarian pretext and special and informational (cyber) operations. 38 This 'non-nuclear deterrence' had relatively solid conceptual foundations. Several years prior to the 2014 doctrine, the GS's research on an indirect approach in warfare recommended increasing 'asymmetrical measures'. 39 GS officers argued that the sophistication of weaponry and the catastrophic consequences incline actors to non-military means. Whereas in the past, the 'brute force' dominated military affairs and the 'indirect approach' had a secondary role, the situation now is reversed.
