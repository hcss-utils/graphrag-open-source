 conceptual pretext and context out of which the current thinking evolved. The second highlights the emergence of conventional and informational (cyber) deterrence theories and describes their merging with the earlier, nuclear deterrence concept into the current 'cross-domain coercion' construct. The third draws on cultural explanations to examine the innovativeness of the Russian concept. The conclusion offers theoretical and practical insights.
The current Russian variation on the theme of cross-domain coercion can be grasped only within its conceptual pretext and context. The Russian concept of deterring conventional aggression by nuclear weapons, which emerged during the 1990s, has been the intellectual pretext of the current approach. The Russian exploration of the changing character of war, under the rubric 'NGW', has been its intellectual context. This exploration gathered momentum following the 2008 War in Georgia, against the backdrop of the Russian conventional military reform. An understanding of these paradigmatic changes in Russian thinking, including the role of modern informational (cyber) warfare, is essential for grasping the current wave of Russian theory and practice of coercion. This section examines both.
Since the Soviet collapse, two strategies of nuclear deterrence gradually emerged in Russia. The first, based on the threat of massive launch-on-warning and retaliation strikes, aimed at deterring nuclear aggression. The second, based on the threat of limited nuclear strikes, aimed at deterring conventional aggression and terminating a large-scale regional war. In most of the Russian references of that period, global deterrence rested on
