 struggle" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) . Moreover, they saw that the aerospace forces relied heavily on information and that "war acquires a qualitatively new component-information. This is due to the emergence of weapon systems based on the extensive use of information technology" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 16) . It is noteworthy that their emphasis on information is related to the application of military means rather than the information-psychological aspect, on which they would put primary emphasis later.
Furthermore, Orekhov and Chekinov discussed the nature of war. They criticized the Military Encyclopedia and the dictionary, which both relied on Clausewitz and defined war as the solving of differences with violence and organized armed struggle, respectively (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 13) . In their view, however, "after Clausewitz, mankind moved forward in two centuries. The wars of the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries differ significantly not only in their content but also in their essence. Modern warfare is a qualitatively new phenomenon" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 13) . While criticizing the Clausewitzian definitions in the two volumes, the authors still insisted that "the main form of struggle [in war] was and remains the armed struggle" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) .
