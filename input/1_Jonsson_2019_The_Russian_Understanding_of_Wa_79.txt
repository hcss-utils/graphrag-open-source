0 and was characterized by precision weapons and information and electronic warfare; the goal was to destroy the enemy's economy with noncontact (i.e., long-distance) warfare. Slipchenko saw that warfare was just about to enter its sixth generation in the 1990s (Slipchenko 2005, 15) .
The Soviet understanding of war came directly from Lenin. He took Clausewitz's classical dictum that "war is merely a continuation of politics by other means" (Clausewitz 1991, 42) , with its implication that war is an instrument of policy, and put it at the core of Soviet military theory:
With reference to wars, the main thesis of dialectics is that "war is simply the continuation of politics by other (i.e., violent) means. " Such is the formula of Clausewitz, one of the greatest writers on the history of war, whose thinking was stimulated by Hegel. And it was always the standpoint of Marx and Engels, who regarded any war as the continuation of the politics of the powers concerned-and the various classes within these countries-in a definite period. (Lenin 1915, 219) This became the foundation for defining war in the Soviet Union. It is important to note that Lenin himself added "violent" and did not use Clausewitz's formal definition that "war is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do your will" (Clausewitz 1991
