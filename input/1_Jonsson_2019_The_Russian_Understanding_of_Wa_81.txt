Like Lenin, Trotsky also saw violence as the defining feature of war. In a discussion at the Military Science Society, he stated that even though "the artificial milieu, or human technology, in the broad sense of the word, has transfigured war just as it has transfigured all other human relations . . . this most general basis [of war] remains unchanged. In other words, war is a hostile encounter between human groups equipped with instruments for killing and destroying, with the direct aim of winning physical dominance over the enemy" (Trotsky 1922) .
Trotsky thus emphasized the physically violent aspect of war and, like Clausewitz, supported the notion that war's nature remains while the ways of fighting change. Trotsky continued to argue that war needed to have social organization and political objectives, otherwise it would merely be animals killing each other (Trotsky 1922 ).
