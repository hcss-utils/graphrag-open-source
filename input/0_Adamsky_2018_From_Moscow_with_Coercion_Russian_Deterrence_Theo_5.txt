 military theory and policy, the terminological apparatus has been inconsistent. As a result, Russian experts among themselves, and their Western colleagues, often mean different things when using the same terms and use different terms to refer to the same things.

The Russian professional discourse uses the terms coercion, deterrence and compellence interchangeably. The Russian equivalent of the Western term deterrencesderzhivanierefers to the efforts to preserve the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more reactive modus operandi. The term compellenceprinuzhdenierefers to the efforts to change the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more proactive connotation.
