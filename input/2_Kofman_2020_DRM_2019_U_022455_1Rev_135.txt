 to employ its own "strategic conventional" arsenal will prove of immense consequence in the Russian leadership's selection of their available courses of action. US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.
Similarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory behind single or grouped strikes, and inflicting dosed damage, does not rest so much on the material damage caused as on the psychological effect it will have on adversary's leadership and the population. This is especially relevant in an alliance context, as the damage applied is meant to create cascade effects on a coalition by targeting specific members. Hence, both damage to the target and damage to its role within a coalition are calibrated.
Much can also be done in how the US chooses to engage Russian counterparts on this subject. Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems. An informed dialogue, that reflects knowledge of the calculus behind Russian planning, may serve better in shaping the other side's confidence levels.
In thinking about escalation management, it does not appear that the Russian military is articulating a theory of victory in the same way that US doctrine envisions defeating an adversary.
