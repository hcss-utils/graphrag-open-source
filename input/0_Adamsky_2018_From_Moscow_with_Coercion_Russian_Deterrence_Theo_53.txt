 policy, until recently, it seems that Russian strategic planners lacked a codified procedure to estimate the conditions under which they would recommend to the senior leadership de-escalation by nuclear means. Russian experts argued until recently that they lacked methodology for calculating an unacceptable level of damage above which the nuclear threshold would be crossed. As of fall 2015, this critical threshold remained undefined. Russian military theoreticians demand the adoption of 'modified McNamara criteria' and the introduction of a procedure for the calculation of prospective and actual damage to critical social-military-economic infrastructure and to political-military command-and-control systems under conventional aggression. 72 Criteria and methodology became very relevant in the case of intra-war coercion that involves escalation dominance and a decision to cross the nuclear threshold in the midst of conventional hostilities, especially when different forms of strategic influence are interconnected and employed simultaneously. This is particularly worrisome in the realm of informational (cyber) struggle, 73 where Russian practitioners do not seem to possess a method for 'direct and indirect battlefield damage assessment'. 74 In sum, these three deficits of the Russian approach put Moscow in danger of pushing itself over the 'culminating point'. Moscow, like strategic communities elsewhere, seeks to signal or act coercively strong enough to maintain, restore or establish new norms of an opponent's strategic behaviour, but without escalation. Strategic theory defines this as a culminating pointa situation when use of force has 'attained the strongest possible position' and when strategists consider
