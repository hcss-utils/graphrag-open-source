How do these three forms of influence relate to each other? The term crossdomain coercion is probably the best description of the Russian art of orchestrating non-nuclear, informational and nuclear influence within a unified programme, which sometimes features in Russian writing as 'strategic deterrence'. The mechanism of this approach that has manifested itself during the recent Russian gambits seems rather straightforward. Informational struggle choreographs all threats across conventional and nuclear, military and non-military domains to produce the most optimal correlation of forces. It is the 'master of ceremonies' of coercion: by exaggerating nuclear and conventional manipulations and muscle flexing, it constructs a cordon sanitaire that affords immune manoeuvring space, a sphere of the possible, within which other forms of influence can achieve tangible results with or preferably without the use of force. Ideally, the image of unacceptable consequences produced by this crossdomain coercion should paralyse the adversary's assertiveness and responsiveness.
Uninterrupted informational deterrence waged on all possible fronts against all possible audiences, augmented by nuclear signalling and supplemented by intra-war coercion, constitutes an integrated cross-domain operation. The main rationale of this operation is to dissuade the adversary from aggression or to deescalate it and impose Russia's will with minimal violence. The amalgamation of different tools of cross-domain coercion ensures that the limitations of
