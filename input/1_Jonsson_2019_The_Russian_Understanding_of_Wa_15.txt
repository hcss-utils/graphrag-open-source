 values and brainwashing of the population so that it will ultimately take to the streets and revolt against its leadership. Color revolutions have grown from being seen as mostly spontaneous uprisings (albeit with foreign support) to a form of warfare orchestrated by the West. After 2014, color revolutions were understood as the West's main geopolitical tool to achieve its political objectives and as a form of warfare (Gerasimov 2014a) . There is agreement among elites and military theorists that the color revolutions were nonviolent events, even though some of the latter events that came to be included in the concept, such as the Arab Spring and the Euromaidan revolt, have included violence. Nonetheless, some Russian theorists objected to the description of the color revolutions as nonviolent because they saw that they were ultimately backed up by violence or the threat thereof. The Western military interventions in Libya and Syria are seen as conceptually separate from the nonviolent color revolutions that were in those cases pretexts for armed interventions. This book shows that the threat of color revolutions increased notably on the political agenda in the period 2004-6, but it took until 2012-14 for them to become mainstream among Russian military theorists.
The broadening of the Russian understanding of war has been a long-term evolutionary process. This is to be seen in contrast to reoccurring calls for a revolution in Russian military thought and practice, often heard after the invasion of Ukraine or the interference in the US election.
