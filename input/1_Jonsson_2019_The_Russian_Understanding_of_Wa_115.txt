 communism, something that presupposed war, according to Lenin. In this sense, Marxist thought contained a paradox of war as an evil that could be fully eradicated only by war. The Soviet understanding of war meant that wars conducted by the Soviet Union were always just, by virtue of their sociopolitical character. Consequently, concepts such as self-defense and aggression were not decided upon based on the particular actions of states, such as invasion, but the goal they could serve. After the advent of nuclear weapons, Khrushchev argued that wars were not inevitable anymore, a view that persisted until the end of the Soviet Union.
The understanding of the nature of war thus remained constant throughout the Soviet Union. Lenin's main definition of war, as the continuation of politics by violent means, remained in the authoritative works throughout this period. The definition was almost identical to that of Clausewitz, but Lenin emphasized the class nature of politics, seeing war as the continuation of class politics by violent means. This, in the Soviet view, went beyond Clausewitz's narrow focus on a unitary state and its foreign policy and better reflected the relations between classes and the ownership of the means of production within states. In this definition, war is an instrument of politics. There was a clear grasp of this among Soviet leaders. Also, its opposite was true: Peace was also an instrument of politics. This meant that both peace and war were seen as instruments, to be applied when suitable without any particular moral barrier
