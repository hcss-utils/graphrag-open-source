 contemporary warfare. At the NATO summit in Wales in September 2014, the alliance stated, "We will ensure that NATO is able to effectively address the specific challenges posed by hybrid warfare threats, where a wide range of overt and covert military, paramilitary, and civilian measures are employed in a highly integrated design" (NATO 2014) .
Since the definition includes all opposing terms, such as military, paramilitary, and civilian, as well as overt and covert, it becomes so vague that it lacks utility. As Michael Kofman argued, "If you torture hybrid warfare long enough it will tell you anything, and torture it we have. The term now covers every type of discernible Russian activity, from propaganda to conventional warfare, and most that exists in between" (Kofman 2016) . The term becomes useless for practical purposes, since any Russian activity can be included in it.
Rather, it is useful to return to the original concept of hybrid warfare authored by Frank Hoffman and James Mattis in 2005 in support of the US Marine Corps's threat concept (Mattis and Hoffman 2005) . Hoffman defined an enemy who uses hybrid threats as "any adversary that simultaneously employs a tailored mix of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, terrorism, and criminal behavior in the same time and battlespace to obtain their political objectives" (Hoffman 2014 ; see also Hoffman 2007 Hoffman , 2009 Hoffman , 2010)) .
