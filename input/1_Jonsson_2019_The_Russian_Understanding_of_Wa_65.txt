 dialectical materialism was seen as the key element of what made Soviet military science scientific. Marxist philosophy and dialectics had their roots in Hegelian dialectics, even if the Marxist tradition developed in opposition to it, especially with regard to the central role of the state for Hegel (Gat 1992, 372) . This philosophical kinship, which included the common focus on historicism, was a key reason why communist military theorists found such affinity with Clausewitz, who was also drawing heavily on Hegel (Gat 1992, 364) . Lenin appreciatively noted Clausewitz's use of dialectics.
A third component that made Soviet military science scientific was its focus on history. Historical analysis was a constituent part of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and seen as critical in the development of Soviet, and later Russian, military theory. As the seminal theorist Svechin put it, "All of strategy is basically a contemplation of military history, " and "the study of strategy is of little use without military historical knowledge" (Svechin 1927, 77) . Or, as similarly put by Ivan Vorobyov and Valery Kiselyov, military history was an "organically indissoluble constituent" of military knowledge and the "nucleus of military science" (Vorobyov and Kiselyov 2013, 43 ; see also Vorobyov and Kiselyov 201
