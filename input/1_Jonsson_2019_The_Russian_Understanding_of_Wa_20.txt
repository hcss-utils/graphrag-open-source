How war is changing is a perennial topic in military theory. However, few Western studies have engaged in depth with how the Russian understanding is changing. Rather, it seems that the debate on how war is changing assumes that war in general is changing and that it is the same (and perceived as the same) for all states. A key insight from the field of strategic culture points out that communities with different cultures and values can look at the same thing but interpret it very differently. As put by Colin Gray, "Culture yields us the truths, small and large, that we know should guide our decisions and actions" (Gray 2007, 8) . Likewise, "strategists and their institutions cannot be acultural and hence will continuously perceive and interpret the material realm culturally" (Poore 2003, 282) . Culture should be seen as a context from which an understanding cannot be isolated. This has been put particularly in the case of Russia as the Russian paradigm is "idiosyncratic, reflect[s] a strong cultural imprint, and need [s] to be analysed in the context of [its] strategic culture" (Adams
