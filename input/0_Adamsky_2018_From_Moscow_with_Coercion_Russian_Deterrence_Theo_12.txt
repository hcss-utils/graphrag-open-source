 limited nuclear use would deter or terminate conventional hostilities, without escalation to a massive nuclear exchange'. 7 Scholars concur that scenario vignettes from the military exercises of that period demonstrated that when a counterattack by nonstrategic nuclear weapons restored the status quo; the adversary did not retaliate and terminated hostilities. 8 This period lasted until about 2009-10 and is relatively familiar to Western scholars. One of its main characteristics has been systemic incoherence. What political declarations, strategic-and operational-level commanders' views, statements by defence and nuclear industry officials and data from military exercises all revealed that Russian thinking on the role of nuclear weapons for deterring and de-escalating regional conventional aggression remained an unelaborated concept, far from a doctrine. Senior officials' statements, national level documents, manuals, professional articles, exercises, and industry modernization programs attributed different missions to this arsenal. Theoretical postulates were unsupported by actual assets, several capabilities existed in a conceptual vacuum, and industry initiatives were disconnected from official policy. 9 Scholars mentioned two factors to explain why the set of Russian ideas has been 'detached from the arsenal that should supposedly support it, making it a vague notion, not calibrated across the strategic community and at the various levels of command'. 10 First, although the Soviet experts explored the mutual assured destruction (MAD)-based mutual deterrence in their works, the broad and elaborated Western theory of deterrence was a novelty for Russian strategic studies when
