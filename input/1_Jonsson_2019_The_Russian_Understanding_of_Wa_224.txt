These four subcategories capture the key ideas of each strand and provide a good basis for discussion. The authors unfortunately did not attempt to gauge the relative prominence of the various competing strands, but they objected to the theoretical value of wars of consciousness. Nonetheless, this strand cannot be discarded, because the ideas of an ongoing war of values, and perhaps civilization, does appear in public doctrines. In terms of the findings of this chapter, it seems that wars
