 earlier Russian thinking. Although a majority of Western experts have devoted attention to Russian nuclear strategy, only a few scholars explored this new cross-domain coercion vision that is driving Moscow's behavior. 1 These important contributions notwithstanding, the new Russian paradigm remains relatively under-explored due to its constant evolution and demands continuous critical analysis. The dearth of knowledge about its cultural underpinnings also looms large.
Only one work has offered cultural explanations of Russian strategic thought, 2 and no research explores the impact of strategic culture on the conceptualisation of deterrence. Finally, while cross-domain coercion emerges as a separate theoretical field, distinct from its nuclear and conventional analogues, a growing body of research that is trying to fill this void 3 so far has overlooked the Russian case. No work has overviewed the intellectual history of the post-Soviet conceptualisation of deterrence and offered a cultural explanation of its current cross-domain state.
This article aims to address these shortcomings. Empirically, it traces the intellectual history of Russian deterrence theory up to its current stage and critically discusses its essence. On the theoretical side, by analysing a case outside of Western strategic thought, which traditionally has dominated deterrence theory, the article demonstrates how strategic concepts evolve differently in various ideational contexts. By utilising cultural explanations to demonstrate the logic underpinning the Russian approach, it articulates a model of cultural imprint on deterrence conceptualisation. Finally, the article advances the study of cross-domain coercion theory
