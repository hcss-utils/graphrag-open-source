 system of knowledge was taking place (Gareyev 2013b) . This is no small statement, given Gareyev's earlier views, and he acknowledged again that the "borderline between war and peace is more vague and less defined" (Gareyev 2013b) . He contended that this partly depended on technological development that enabled nonmilitary means to take a dangerous and "practically violent" character (Gareyev 2013b ).
However, Gareyev seemed cautious of the logical extensions of his thoughts. He stated that if these actions truly are to be considered as war, then the world would be in a continual state of war, and this is a concept of war that Russia could not introduce unilaterally (Gareyev 2013b) . It is not a stretch for him to conclude that these new means would count as war. Rather than rebutting the intellectual merits of that argument, he countered them with a practical one. He argued that Russia could not itself introduce a new concept of war, which needed to be done multilaterally. However, this is not a fully persuasive argument. It would seem he was reaching for a legal/practical way to avoid what he reasoned theoretically. That is to say, if the progress of technology and society has allowed nonmilitary means to be seen as violent, then there is a case for including them in the concept of war if war is defined by
