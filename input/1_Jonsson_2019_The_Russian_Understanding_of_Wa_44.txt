 the majority of stakeholders involved in the drafting process accept their content. The doctrines hold formal status as the basis for national security planning. Moreover, following Soviet tradition, these doctrines are useful to analyze because they go far beyond Western ones in terms of what questions they answer and their military-theoretical depth and detail. The military doctrines not only direct the armed forces but the whole of the state's organization for war (voyennoye organisatsiya gosudarstvo).
The statements of the political elites are important as they reveal perceptions of war among those in power. A drawback of analyzing the political elites' statements is that they are less likely to venture into depth on military issues or have a military-theoretical foundation. Among the political elites, particular weight is given to the president, the minister of defense, and the head of the Security Council. The military theorists are crucial as they have the militarytheoretical expertise to analyze how war is changing. Among military theorists, the views of the chief of the General Staff-the highest-ranking officer, the deputy defense minister, and the person with the utmost responsibility in leading the military-theoretical development-are of particular importance. This book will also focus on theorists involved in drafting the public security doctrines and with influential positions in the military-theoretical debates and the General Staff.
To be clear, there is no such thing as a single understanding of war, either in Russia or elsewhere. It is an aggregate of different views that can be more or less conforming.
