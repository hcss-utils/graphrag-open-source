There was indeed agreement on the centrality of information warfare, although in different aspects. Giles argued that Western decision-makers "cannot afford to underestimate the extent to which Russian concepts and approaches in information activities differ from what they may take for granted": above, an overt state of conflict with Russia need not necessarily exist in order for Russian capabilities to be deployed.
