 and responsible for key capabilities of force employment and planning, took the view that color revolutions have created a major change in world politics. In his view, they are "a real change in the nature of military threats and challenges to security" (Zarudnitsky 2014, 45) . The West, Zarudnitsky continued, saw color revolutions as a nonviolent means to overthrow undemocratic regimes. However, "military analysis of the events that occurred in the Middle East and North Africa makes it possible to claim the reverse-that military force is an inalienable feature of 'color revolutions'" (Zarudnitsky 2014, 45) . Indeed, he saw that violence "is present at every stage of the escalation" (Zarudnitsky 2014, 45) . He also argued against the perception of color revolutions as of nonviolent nature: The "reason to reject the peaceful and non-violent nature of 'color revolutions' is that the condition of countries that have suffered military aggression as classically understood and of countries experiencing 'color revolutions' is almost identical" (Zarudnitsky 2014, 45) . Thus, he saw widespread change in the nature of military threats and security due to color revolutions in their capacity as a key threat, but he rejected the notion that they should be understood as nonviolent and saw their effects as similar to military aggression.
