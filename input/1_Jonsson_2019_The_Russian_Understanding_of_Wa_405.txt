It is thus interesting that Bartosh emphasized both that color revolutions could be part of armed struggle and that he saw them as a use of force. In 2018, Bartosh directly attributed the Euromaidan revolt to the West while stating that "through a hybrid war, conditions are created for the color revolution, providing for a coup d' Ã©tat and the overthrow of a government by a controlled crowd" (Bartosh 2018 ). This he saw was done by shifting to the nonforceful part of the spectrum, which "allows for depriving the opposing side of actual sovereignty without seizing the territory by military force" (Bartosh 2018 ; see also Bartosh 2017) .
Another detailed view of how color revolutions function came from Andrew Korybko. He saw a common framework for color revolutions, arguing that "since the 'Bulldozer Revolution' 2 in Serbia over a decade ago, the Color Revolution has evolved into the Arab Spring, and now morphed into EuroMaidan, a new type of warfare for our century" (Korybko 2014) . The framework consisted of
