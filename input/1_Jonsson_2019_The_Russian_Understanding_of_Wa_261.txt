 voices did not receive a lot of mainstream traction, and the authoritative views of war still clearly focused on military violence as the defining factor. Nonetheless, many of the key notions that were later incorporated into mainstream military theory first appeared then, such as the blurring boundary between war and peace, nonmilitary means being violent, information being a weapon, and nonmilitary means being more effective than military means and sufficient in and of themselves to achieve strategic outcomes. This underlines the long-term evolution of Russian military thought, often overlooked in the Western debate. The discussion has run in parallel with a discussion of how conventional military means are seen to change, which has focused on the increasing utility of high-precision, longrange weapons, depending mostly on Slipchenko's work.
Even though the then defense minister Ivanov stated in 2005 that Russia was in an undeclared war, it took until after the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 for the idea to gain ascendancy in Russia that the concept of war needed to be broadened. Thereafter, the majority of the authoritative actors in Russian national security and military theory started seeing that nonmilitary measures were so effective that they were affecting the understanding of war. This shift was also reflected, although less explicitly, in the public security doctrines. The broadening of an understanding of war is due to the increased importance of nonmilitary means and especially information warfare and the threat from color revolutions.
