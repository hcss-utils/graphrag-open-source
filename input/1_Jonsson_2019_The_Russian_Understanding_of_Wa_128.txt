 Remote and contactless, 2004). 1 In his books, articles, and speeches, he gradually developed the idea that a new generation of warfare (the sixth) was coming. This referred to a type of war conducted over long distances, mainly fought with long-range precision-guided missiles, without soldiers coming into direct contact with each other. Slipchenko criticized the analyses that treated innovations in weapon systems as a revolution-for example, those who saw a new tank, the Kalashnikov rifle, or satellites as revolutionary (Slipchenko 2005, 15) . Rather, for him, there had been only six real generations of warfare.
The 1991 Gulf War was seen by Slipchenko as a prototype of sixthgeneration warfare. That is to say, it could not fully be classified as a war of the sixth generation, but it displayed many of the characteristics of distance and noncontact warfare. Iraqi forces were numerically superior to the American forces, but they were in the fourth generation of warfare, just like Russia's, and were easily defeated with superior C 4 ISR and precision-guided missiles and a small land force (Slipchenko 2005, 20) . Thus, it was seen as a break from earlier wars of a close-contact nature (Slipchenko 2005, 18) . The fifth generation of war (nuclear war) was also seen to be of a noncontact nature. However, since nuclear
