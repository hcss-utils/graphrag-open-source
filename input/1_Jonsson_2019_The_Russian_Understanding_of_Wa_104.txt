 less relevant (key concepts in Western just war theory). Rather, "those guided by just aims would use just methods, and from their progressive aims would come just consequences. The problem of evaluating means and results was therefore of negligible importance" (Lider 1977, 221) . Vigor demonstrated this using the example of British-French aggression in Crimea in the 1850s; even though they were both capitalist states and aggressors, Marx and Engels supported them (Vigor 1975, 61) . The key reason for this was that they thought the war would help to bring about the fall of the czar. Vigor thus concluded that in the Soviet view there is no "objective" definition of aggression or self-defense. Rather, even if a capitalist country is clearly attacked first, it would not have the moral right to self-defense, and the aggression would not be condemnable if it was taken to further the revolutionary process (Vigor 1975, 60, 62, 64) .
In the same manner as the justness of a war, the distinction between offense and defense was not decided by particular actions but rather by the sociopolitical constitution of states. Thus, the invasion of Finland in 1939, the deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba that led to the crisis of 1962, the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 were all considered defensive actions by Soviet
