The aim of this book very much echoes the way Gray approached writing on Soviet nuclear strategy. He wrote that it would be a major error to approach Soviet nuclear strategy as if it were an extant mosaic to be uncovered by the prodigious scholarly efforts of Western archeologist-strategists. . . . One should approach the subject expecting a quality of evidence more suitable for the securing, by analogy, of conviction in a civil
