In both cases, more is lost than is gained and the coercion programme becomes a self-defeating overreaction.
The policymaking discourse in Moscow and in the Western capitals is already rife with the mutual misperceptions, mirror imaging and attribution of non-existent intentions and capabilities. This may be due in part to the fact that Moscow is interacting with the West while its deterrence mechanism is not yet finalised and its theory and practice are constantly evolving. In part, it may be because the West engages Moscow with only a vague understanding of the conceptual foundations and perception of Russian strategists. A recommendation for policymakers would be to initiate academic exchanges and second-track activities with Russian defence intellectuals to co-explore theoretical constructs of deterrence and to co-share indigenous perceptions on the subject. These conceptual-theoretical engagements on the nature of deterrence and cross-domain coercion may better educate Russian and Western policymakers about each other and reduce
