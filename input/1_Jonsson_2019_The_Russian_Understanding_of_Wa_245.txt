 in the Russian debate can thus be captured in Gerasimov's statement. On the one hand, he wants to insist that war is defined by armed violence, but on the other he also says that unarmed means are becoming violent and that they are blurring the boundary of war and peace.
The 2010 Military Doctrine applied five different concepts to describe war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and largescale war (each clearly defined in the introduction). "Military conflict" was a general term that encompassed all the others. "Armed conflict" meant an armed clash on a limited scale. A "local war" referred to states pursuing limited military goals with military action that primarily affects those states. "Regional war" was seen to have more important aims, and both conventional and nuclear means could be involved, as well as air, sea, or space operations. Finally, "large-scale war" included a significant number of states that pursued radical military-political goals (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.6d-h). The Military Doctrine stated that military conflicts are defined by their objectives and the forms and methods of struggle (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.11 ). This appears similar to the view of Gareyev, who reasoned that it is the method that distinguishes the perpetration of war from warfare (perhaps unsurprising, as Gareyev was one of the authors of the doctrine).
