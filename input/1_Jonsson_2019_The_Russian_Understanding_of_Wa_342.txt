This notion was also echoed by a few Western analysts. Giles saw that "examining Russian assessments of current events makes it clear that it considers itself to be engaged in full-scale information warfare" (Giles 2016b, 27; Giles 2015b, 1) . He added that "the perceived threat is an existential one" (Giles 2016b, 37) . Blank saw that "we may believe we are at peace with Russia, but Russian leaders do not share this view" (Blank 2013, 42) .
