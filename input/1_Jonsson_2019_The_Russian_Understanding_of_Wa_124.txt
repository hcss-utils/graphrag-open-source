. It agrees with the tendency among some late Soviet theorists, discussed in the previous chapter, to shift away from defining war solely as an armed struggle. He argued that armed struggle is "a part of war-war being a complex social and political phenomenon embracing all spheres of life in the nations engaged, with diverse ways of fighting the enemy including industrial, political and psychological means, with armed struggle being paramount among them" (Gareyev 1998, viii) .

He further argued that the essence of war cannot be changed, even by the invention of nuclear weapons (Gareyev 1998, 19) . This is a response to arguments that nuclear war cannot be considered an instrument of policy since it would lead to mutually assured destruction and hence fail to achieve political objectives. Gareyev acknowledged that it is in general very hard to achieve political goals with nuclear weapons but that this was rather a question of expediency than a change in the nature of war. To support this, he referred to the only time when nuclear weapons have been used, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki; both cases made it clear that they served US policy (Gareyev 1998, 20) . This brought Gareyev into line with the Clausewitzian and
