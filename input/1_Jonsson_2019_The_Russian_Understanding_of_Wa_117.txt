 seeing war as an armed struggle did not exhaust the concept of war but rather needed to include the other means of influencing the enemy. The definition of war started to shift modestly at the end of the Soviet Union. For instance, the 1986 encyclopedia, as quoted above, defined armed struggle as the main form of war, while mentioning the role of nonmilitary means in war. There seemed to be a paradox in the Soviet understanding of war. On the one hand, war was clearly defined as the continuation of politics by violent means, which implied a clear connection to advancing policy. On the other, the inevitability of war created by the sheer existence of exploitative systems seemed to make war an almost automatic, perhaps irrational occurrence. That said, Marxist theorists were clear that the exploitative class would use war as an instrument of its politics to protect and expand its positions.
To conclude, this chapter found an essentially static way of understanding the nature of war among Soviet leaders and military thinkers. The only significant changes were that the notion of the inevitability of war was amended and, among some military thinkers, nonmilitary means were included in war, while armed violence remained the defining feature. Even if propaganda and subversion held an important role in the conduct of conflict, they did not affect the definition of war. This was the military thinking that the newly established Russian Federation inherited, which the next chapter will analyze.
