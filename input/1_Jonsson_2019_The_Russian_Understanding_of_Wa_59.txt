 The starting point for investigating the nature of war was the established views and ideology of the Communist Party. It was from the precepts therein that Soviet military science drew when forming its system of knowledge. This included the character of war, the laws of war, the preparation of the armed forces for war, and the methods of waging war (Scott and Scott 1982, 5) . The authoritative framework was set out at the creation of the Soviet Union by Vladimir Lenin and Leon Trotsky, commissar The first point that rendered Soviet military science particular is its insistence on holism, the belief that everything is connected in a single synthetic system. All issues are analyzed with the function of the system in mind. This, Adamsky argued, is to be seen in contrast with the Western analytical-logical tradition that starts from the microlevel processes and then goes on to aggregate them (Adamsky 2010, 40) . This was also the interpretation of the military historian David Glantz, who argued that "this tendency to treat war as a totality of military, economic, political, and social measures differentiated Bolshevik strategy from that of its opponents" (Glantz 1992, 16 ).
