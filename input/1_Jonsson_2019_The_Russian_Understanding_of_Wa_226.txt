In modern conflict, "the aggressor state exerts pressure on the victim state, increasingly using an unconventional model of confrontation" (Kartapolov 2015, 26) . This could be used to legitimize a military intervention. This method, according to Kartapolov, started long before the Ukrainian crisis and represented a qualitative increase in the anti-Russian campaign (Kartapolov 2015, 28) . The goal of the United States and its allies was no longer the destruction of the enemy but rather to subordinate the will of the elites, which was achieved with so-called hybrid actions, both military and nonmilitary (Kartapolov 2015, 28) . Most notable to Kartapolov, these included the use of information-psychological warfare, armed groups of internal opposition, and special forces (Kartapolov 2015, 29) . For Kartapolov, a so-called hybrid action could then escalate to "classical war" if necessary (Kartapolov 2015, 29) .
