This is somewhat different from the Western military thought focused more on the kinetic activity.

Russian cross-domain coercion that links together nuclear, conventional and informational tools of strategic influence is the most recent evolution in the Russian art of strategy. What are the ramifications of this approach for policy and theory?
On the one hand, cross-domain coercion expands the continuum of options on
