eterred if its military establishment has developed several plausible options for escalation management and war termination from crisis to large-scale war. These employ flexible means, many of which are usable because they are either conventional or non-forceful in nature, while others represent an iterative approach to nuclear escalation which inherently eschews the notion that it may be uncontrolled.
Hence, the Russian political leadership may consider a conflict, even against a superior adversary, as a risky but ultimately manageable affair. We do not know Russian confidence levels in such strategies, but their development and codification in national security concepts points to some degree of high-level adoption. A system of deterrence exists in Russian military strategy, and whether or not political leadership is briefed of its component plans, they appear to echo the overarching concepts such as "strategic deterrence." The more confident the Russian leadership is in the ability to manage escalation, and in the existence of workable war termination strategies in each possible type of war (local, regional, and large-scale), the more likely they are to engage in activities short of war or competitions in risk taking.

By developing an interlinked series of approaches that range from intimidation to inflicting calibrated damage for the purpose of escalation management, the Russian military has not traded warfighting for intra-war deterrence. The means involved, and
