; it focuses on warfighting capabilities while a tremendous cognitive gap remains on the question of escalation management and war termination. The absence of a theory of escalation management or approaches that could affect war termination, remains a significant deficit in strategy for great power war. Warfighting by itself is an inadequate hedge strategy should deterrence fail, when envisioning that such a war would be fought against a peer nuclear adversary. It fails to account for the challenge of controlled escalation stratagems employed by adversaries, the prospect that an adversary's plan for cost imposition or systemic destruction might prove effective, and the risk of uncontrolled escalation resulting from misperceptions.
By understanding the assumptions and targeting requirements involved in Russian planning for escalation management, US planners could invest better in defense, resilience, and approaches that would alter the adversary's calculus. In any strategy, the other side gets a vote. Presumably the Russian military must force-generate assets during different periods of escalation, making both the forces involved and their potential targets predictable, whether it is seeking to inflict "deterrent damage" in efforts to manage escalation or "assigned damage" in warfighting.
Russian thinking is increasingly clear on the role and utility of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including the timing of their employment and their likely targets. Russian writings offer a good glimpse into when, how, and against what targets nuclear weapons might be used. Russian deliberations on the threat posed by theater US missile defense to these calibrated escalation approaches also telegraph one of
