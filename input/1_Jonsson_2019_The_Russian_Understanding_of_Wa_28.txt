While providing an in-depth overview of both Western and Russian military thought and what can be included in the concept of hybrid warfare, Fridman's argument regarding the use of gibridnaya voina in Russia is overreaching. As he himself pointed out, the concept was not used until it regained popularity in the West after 2014. Furthermore, when used in the Russian debate by key figures, it is more a passing reference rather than a central concept or tradition of thought. Fridman overemphasizes the importance of gibridnaya voina as a concept used in Russian military thought and neglects other concepts, such as color revolutions, controlled chaos, and simply nonmilitary means, that have long been (and remain) central in the Russian debate (see chapter 2). As Fridman himself stated, "In Russian political discourse, it is difficult to find direct references to terms such as net-centric wars or subversion wars, gibridnaya voyna or gibridnaya metody" (Fridman 2018, 144) . In this sense, it becomes strange to fit the Russian military-theoretical tradition into a mostly unused concept that often refers to Western conduct when used.
Fridman's characterization of gibridnaya voina as solely being about nonmilitary and nonviolent means becomes too narrow a categorization in which to fit Russian military thought. It goes against Gerasim
