 and Clausewitzian definitions, war is understood as an instrument of politics and specifically class politics in Marxist-Leninism. This is not an uncommon way to see war, but it could differ somewhat from the Western understanding. In the Soviet view, the underlying policy of a government remained, while it used peace or war as instruments to further its policy depending on circumstance (Vigor 1975, 8) . In other words, "Peace is assessed in precisely the same way as war" (Lider 1977, 223) . In the West, Peter Vigor argued, perhaps provocatively, that war was conversely understood as a "terrible disaster which bursts upon men as a kind of act of god, erupting for no reason and conducted for purposes which are never implemented when the fighting has stopped" (Vigor 1975, 5) . This argument hinted at clearer understanding of war's instrumental role. The consequence of this view is both war and peace as instruments of policy. In Lenin's view, Vigor contended, it would have been ridiculous to think of peace as apart from war; rather, if war was the continuation of politics, peace needed to be as well (Vigor 1975, 87) . The Soviet view entailed an understanding that peace, in any other sense than an absence of fighting, was unattainable as long as a capitalist system existed (Scott and Scott 1988, 113)
