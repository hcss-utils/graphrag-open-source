Since NGW is less about traditional military destruction but rather targets the adversary's perception to affect its will and choices, the role of the informational domain looms unprecedentedly large. Its addition to the traditional domains 54 is a second novelty.

Against the backdrop of miniaturisation of hard power to the necessary minimum, when perception turns into the centre of gravity, informational struggle becomes one of the main tools for achieving the goals of cross-domain coercion.

Moreover, to judge the innovation by the yardstick of Russian strategic culture, these qualities represent continuity rather than change. The discussion below demonstrates that the peculiarities of the Russian approach that Western experts sometimes present as novelties actually reflect the Russian strategic mentality and military tradition. Thus, the Western puzzlement perhaps stemmed from a lack of expertise in Russian military thought
