 of the changing character of war. The first wave focused on nuclear deterrence, the second scrutinised conventional deterrence and the third explored informational (cyber) deterrence. Eventually, three waves merged into the current cross-domain coercion vision. Chronologically, this evolution had two periods. The first period, from 1991 till the 2010, emphasised nuclear weapons in deterring conventional aggressionthe first wave of theory. The second period, from 2010 onward, harmonised the nuclear tool, without diminishing its role, with other tools of coercion, specifically within the non-nuclear and informational (cyber) domains. The last two theory waves developed knowledge precisely for this task, gathering momentum within the intellectual climate shaped by the notion of 'New Generation Warfare' (NGW) and against the backdrop of conventional military reform.
The relatively extensive body of research on the subject is not without caveats. The new Russian concept differs both from the Western conceptualisation of deterrence and from the earlier Russian thinking. Although a majority of Western experts have devoted attention to Russian nuclear strategy, only a few scholars explored this new cross-domain coercion vision that is driving Moscow's behavior. 1 These important contributions notwithstanding, the new Russian paradigm remains relatively under-explored due to its constant evolution and demands continuous critical analysis. The dearth of knowledge about its cultural underpinnings also looms large.
Only one work has offered cultural explanations of Russian strategic thought, 2 and no research explores the
