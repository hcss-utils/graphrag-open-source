 and asked if the Arab Spring was the typical war for the twenty-first century. He furthermore saw that information resources had become one of the most effective weapons. Similarly, Chekinov and Bogdanov saw that unconventional warfare and warfare of controlled chaos were defining international relations today, in which nonmilitary means, notably information and psychological warfare, were key to victory. This made military means secondary, and they saw that nonmilitary means could remove military threats. Moreover, Kartapolov saw that indirect actions were a new type of war in parallel with classical war. Many theorists, most notably Gareyev, also saw that the nonmilitary means were so effective that they should be considered violent in nature. Therefore, Gareyev called for a reconsideration of the whole system of knowledge surrounded war, traditionally defined by armed violence.
Even though several theorists have argued for views that would entail a change in the nature of war, only a few have explicitly stated that the nature of war should not be understood as armed violence alone anymore. Rather, a common way to handle the paradox of defining war by armed violence and the increasing utility of nonmilitary means has been to introduce new concepts. Examples include nonmilitary war, wars of controlled chaos, unconventional warfare, information warfare, hybrid warfare, subversion-war, and wars of consciousness. Similarly, the adaptive approach to the use of force as proposed by Gerasimov (and relied on by others) sees the West's primary use
