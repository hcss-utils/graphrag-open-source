 the armed element, which thus was the defining feature. In the doctrine, the concept of war was also followed by "armed conflict" in parenthesis for clarification (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.2). Therefore, the 1993 doctrine sees war and armed conflict as synonymous.
Nonetheless, the doctrine departed from the Soviet view in three notable aspects. The first was the change from the view that wars were inevitable. The doctrine asserted that confrontation generated by ideological antagonism could be overcome via cooperation (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1) in the context of improving East-West relations at the time. The doctrine even went as far as to state that the Russian Federation regarded no state as its enemy (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1). Second, the policy declared by Brezhnev of no first use of nuclear weapons against nuclear states and nonuse against nonnuclear states was dropped (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 81) . Rather, the doctrine did not mention any principles of no first use and that the nonuse of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states was valid only if they were a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and were not cooperating with a nuclear state (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 81) . This most likely reflected the loss of the Soviet Union's conventional superiority over the West (Fitzgerald 199
