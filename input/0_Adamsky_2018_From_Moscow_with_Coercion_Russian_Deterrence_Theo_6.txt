 express a concept similar to the Western term coercion. The context usually indicates which of the forms of influence authors are referring to. Second, the terminological discrepancy has perceptual underpinnings. Western experts often dub the current Russian approach 'hybrid warfare' (HW), implying that Moscow incorporates nonmilitary, information, cyber, and nuclear, conventional and sub-conventional tools of influence in an orchestrated campaign. Russian experts, however, never utilise this term to describe their own approach. Ironically, they envision their concept of 'NGW', which somewhat resonates with the concept of cross-domain deterrence,4 as a response to what they see as a Western 'hybrid campaign' against Russia.
Several scholars are aware of these inconsistencies. The most advanced effort, so far, to calibrate this terminological disorder has been by using the term 'strategic deterrence'. 5 As Kristine Ven Bruusgaard correctly indicates, Russian and Western sources sometimes use this term to refer to a comprehensive deterrence concept that is broader than the nuclear realm and aimed at shaping a conflict. 6 Although the term did appear recently in the Russian military dictionary, the Russian discourse seldom utilises it. For this and the following reasons, this article does not use the term 'strategic deterrence' and instead introduces the term 'cross-domain coercion' to refer to the phenomenon under scrutiny. First, this will prevent confusion with Russian references to the use of the nuclear arsenal to deter a nuclear threat,
