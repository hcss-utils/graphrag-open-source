 danger and sacrifice to which the modern self-centered person is not inclined" and therefore "the center of gravity in war moves toward the struggle with lighter and more popular weapons. This changed the face of war" (Messner 1959, 79) . Messner gave weight to the psychological dimension and psychological warfare. He argued that "in previous wars, the conquest of the territory was important. Henceforth, the conquest of souls in the hostile state will be the most important" (Messner 1960, 109) . With this understanding of the center of gravity, Messner saw notable changes in war itself:
In the past wars, the front line dividing the enemies was vague where the partisans in the rear of one side or another blurred it. In future wars, war will not be linear but on the entire surface of the territories of both enemies because behind the military front there will be political, social, economic fronts; war will not be two-dimensional [land and sea], as in the past, nor three-dimensional, as it became with the birth of military aviation, but fourdimensional, with the psyche of the belligerent populations as the fourth dimension. (Messner 1960, 109) Messner saw that a subversion-war was "first and foremost psychological: If in classic wars, the psychology of permanent armies was of great importance, then in the present epoch of national troops and belligerent popular movements, psychological factors become dominant"
