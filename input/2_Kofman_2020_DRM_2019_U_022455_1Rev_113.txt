 operations could involve precision weapons with either conventional or nuclear warheads. 174 Strategic operations remain a moving target in terms of proposals and conceptualization, a number are referenced commonly indicating that they have been formally adopted i.e. they are discussed as discrete operations that exist, while others are perhaps contemplated for the future and remain under development. For example, Russian analysts discuss prospective strategic operations that merge other operations conceptually, like a strategic deterrence forces operation and a strategic operation of general purpose forces. From their standpoint a further reduction is desirable, while perhaps adding others such as a strategic space operation.175 Some analysts also argue for the importance of the information dimension, even positing the possibility of a strategic operation at the theater of information combat. 176 Writings in Russian military articles suggest a shift toward the operational integration of conventional and nuclear forces. Before the advent of strategic conventional systems, integration involved the potential use of NSNW and SNF in strategic operations, with NSNW focused particularly on an opponent's missile defense infrastructure. Since 2011, there has been a trend toward discussing integrated employment of conventional and nuclear precision strike systems in an operational context. In a recent article in the journal Military Thought, for example, analysts from the 27 TsNII described the current components of Russia's "strategic deterrence" system as potentially trending toward the following state of operational integration:
