 peace as instruments of policy. In Lenin's view, Vigor contended, it would have been ridiculous to think of peace as apart from war; rather, if war was the continuation of politics, peace needed to be as well (Vigor 1975, 87) . The Soviet view entailed an understanding that peace, in any other sense than an absence of fighting, was unattainable as long as a capitalist system existed (Scott and Scott 1988, 113) . The class struggle was continuous, even though it did not necessarily require armed conflict when the political circumstances did not favor war (e.g., the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918) .
It is often thought that the Marxist-Leninist affinity for Clausewitz also came from Marx and Engels (see, e.g., Byron 1950 ), but that does not seem to be the case upon closer scrutiny. Azar Gat showed convincingly how Engels found Clausewitz burdensome and preferred Antoine-Henri Jomini, while Marx likely never read him (Gat 1992, 367) . Their correspondence showed that they discussed, and approved of, the idea that war was an art rather than a science, but this exchange did not go much deeper (Gat 1992, 367) . Rather, it was Trotsky who had the strongest admiration for Clausewitz. Related to seeing war as an instrument of politics, Trotsky
