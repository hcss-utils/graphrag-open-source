At the same time, as the opportunities were seen to be rising to conduct warfare without it being classified as such, Vitaly Tsymbal at the Russian Ministry of Defense concluded in a conference paper that "from a military point of view, the use of information warfare against Russia will categorically not be considered a non-military phase of a conflict . . . considering the possible catastrophic consequences of the use of strategic information warfare means by an enemy" (quoted in Thomas 1996, 26) .
