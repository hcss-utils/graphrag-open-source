 the Military Doctrines and Security Strategies touched on the attempt to alter the psychological situation of Russia in similar terms but without naming a perpetrator. Furthermore, is interesting to see how their focus has shifted from earlier, when they were almost exclusively focusing on ideas connected to Slipchenko's sixth-generation warfare.
In opposition to the broad understanding of war, the Russian historian Vladimir Makhonin proposed a terminological hierarchy in a study of how war and armed conflict is related. The hierarchy saw social conflict-defined as extreme and intense differences between entities-as the preceding stage to all more intense forms of conflict (Makhonin 2011, 155) . In this hierarchy, military conflict represented a clash on a limited scale, whereas war was a large-scale clash (Makhonin 2011, 152) . In Makhonin's view, war was the highest stage of conflict, followed by social conflict; in the view of Chekinov and Bodganov, for instance, armed conflict was just one of the tools in war, and the state of war preceded its application. This represents a division whereby Makhonin saw war as the most intense form of fighting (and potentially anachronistic) and social conflict as the relevant legitimizing factor, while the other notion of war saw it as a condition that allows a variety of means, including (but not limited to) armed violence.
Indeed, more theorists started to argue against the concept of war as solely defined
