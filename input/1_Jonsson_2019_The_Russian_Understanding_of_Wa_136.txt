 catastrophic consequences of the use of strategic information warfare means by an enemy" (quoted in Thomas 1996, 26) . That is to say, the conduct of information warfare will be considered equal to military conflict. Taken together, Modestov and Tsymbal's arguments suggest that the Russian view both permitted information warfare against others without seeing it as waging war but would at the same time consider the same measures taken against itself as war.
It was with this in mind that V. P. Gulin proposed "a new conception of war. " He wrote that with the "informatization of all sides of social life we are witnessing a true revolution in the military sphere" that would necessitate qualitatively new armed forces (Gulin 1997, 50) . Gulin stated that armed struggle had been believed to be the main feature of war but that social violence could now take many forms: political, economic, ideological, and diplomatic (Gulin 1997, 51) . For this reason, Gulin argued, war should not be understood mainly in terms of armed struggle but rather by the consistent features of the uncompromising struggle (Gulin 1997, 51) . The interesting part about Gulin's argument is that he solved the question of what war is by expanding the definition of violence. For him, forms of warfare that are not violent in the physical sense (e.g., social violence) could still amount to war.
