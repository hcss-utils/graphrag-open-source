 view that the nature of war could never change.
A more explicit argument on whether war had entered a new era came from Chief of the General Staff Gerasimov. In an oft-cited speech for the Academy of Military Science in 2013, he spoke of "blurring the distinctions between a state of war and peace" (Gerasimov 2013) . Gerasimov was referring to the effectiveness of nonmilitary means whose destruction and impact can have effects comparable to a real war. The blurring boundaries of war and peace is a repetition of earlier theorists' ideas, notably Gareyev's. Gerasimov saw that "the very 'rules of war'" were changing and that conventional military means might be used only in a later, final stage (Gerasimov 2013 ). The next year, Gerasimov termed this "the adaptive approach to the use of force" (Gerasimov 2014a ). This meant that the West's main response to the use of force was nonviolent color revolutions, and should they fail to produce the desired regime change, there would be an escalation to the traditional use of force (Gerasimov 2014a ).
Gerasimov also proposed in his 2013 speech that rather than see the Arab Spring as not being war, the opposite could be true-that Arab Spring-style revolts could be the typical war in the twenty-first century (Gerasimov
