This is most likely referring to a combination of military means, notably high-precision long-range weapons, and nonmilitary means. That was what Andrei Kokoshin-the ranking civilian in the Ministry of Defense until 1997 and former head of the Security Council-called for in 2011. He saw that too much faith in nuclear deterrence would be detrimental to Russian security and that high-precision and long-range weapons gave an opportunity to enhance the overall deterrent (Kokoshin 2011, 57-58) .
