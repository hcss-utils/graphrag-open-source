 as in the past, nor three-dimensional, as it became with the birth of military aviation, but fourdimensional, with the psyche of the belligerent populations as the fourth dimension. (Messner 1960, 109) Messner saw that a subversion-war was "first and foremost psychological: If in classic wars, the psychology of permanent armies was of great importance, then in the present epoch of national troops and belligerent popular movements, psychological factors become dominant" (Messner 1960, 101) . He continued: "The people's army is a psychological organism, the people's movement is a purely psychological phenomenon. The war of troops and popular movements-subversion-war-is a psychological war" (Messner 1960, 101) . Likewise, he stated that "the revolution is a psychological phenomenon" (Messner 1960, 103) and that winning battles and territorial conquests were not important by themselves but rather that "they are valuable mainly for their psychological effect" (Messner 1960, 131) .
In the subversion-war, Messner saw that "there is no division between the army and the population-all are fighting with different degrees of intensity and persistence"-and that "the regular army has lost its military monopoly" (Messner 1959, 70) . Thus, subversion-war becomes "a war of all against all" (Messner 1960, 110) .
