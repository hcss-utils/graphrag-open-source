 guided politics, economics, and war.
Lenin contended in Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism that "imperialist wars are absolutely inevitable under such an economic system where private property in the means of production exists" (Lenin 1916a, 28) . This represented a continuation of the thought of Marx and Engels and became one of the core points of the Soviet understanding of war. Wars were, Lenin argued, "inseparable from the political systems that engender them" (Lenin 1917, 25) . Wars would inevitably occur by virtue of the existence of exploitative political systems, until the whole world has become communist. In the "Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution, " Lenin wrote, "Only after the proletariat has disarmed the bourgeoisie will it be able, without betraying its world-historic mission, to consign all armaments to the scrap-heap" (Lenin 1916b, 2, italics in the original) . This view of perpetual conflict was confirmed by Frunze, one of the most acclaimed Soviet military theorists and commissar for the army and navy in 1925, who saw that "between our proletarian state and all the rest of the bourgeois world there can be only a state of long, stubborn, desperate war to the death" (Frunze 1921, 30 ; see also Svechin 1927, 91)
