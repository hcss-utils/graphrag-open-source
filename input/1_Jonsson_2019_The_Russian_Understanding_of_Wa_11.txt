; Gerasimov 2014a; Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016) . Albeit less explicitly, the shifting understanding of war was also reflected in the main security doctrines, which emphasized the role of information warfare in both war and peacetime that could reach strategic goals by itself, as well as ideological confrontations related to color revolutions.
The views that nonmilitary and nonviolent means are so effective that they should be considered violent, blurring the boundary between war and peace, and an ongoing form of warfare are hardly compatible with the traditional understanding of war as defined by armed violence. Rather, the understanding of nature of war among current Russian theorists and elites has broadened and cannot anymore be seen as solely defined by armed force. This understanding has gone from being voiced by a few theorists to the mainstream of Russian thought, as reflected by security doctrines and key officials.
While central theorists and elites have implied a change in the nature of war, there has not been an unequivocal authoritative statement that war is no longer defined solely by armed violence or the threat thereof. However, this should not be expected, and such a declaration would have significant consequences. First, the concept of armed attack and armed violence is the basis of international law as well as the Russian federal law On Defense, which regulates the use of the armed forces. Such recognition would, given the Russian leadership's perception of these means as ongoing, mean that Russia now would be in a state of war.
