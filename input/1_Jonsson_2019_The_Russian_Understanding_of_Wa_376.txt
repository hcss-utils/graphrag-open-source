In an article titled "Russia and the Changing World, " he said that he had watched the Arab Spring with hope, but then the revolts turned violent. He stated that "foreign interference in support of one side of a domestic conflict and the use of power in this interference gave developments a negative aura" (Putin 2012c) . Thereafter, he emphasized the information sphere in the Arab Spring revolts in which "the Internet, social networks, cell phones etc. have turned into an effective tool for the promotion of domestic and international policy on a par with television" (Putin 2012c ). Putin saw the concept of soft power as "tools and methods to reach foreign policy goals without the use of arms but by exerting information and other levers of influence" (Putin 2012c) . He lamented the use of these methods to provoke extremist sentiments and interfere in the domestic policy of other countries and noted that "the activities of "pseudo-NGOs" and other agencies that try to destabilize other countries with outside support are unacceptable" (Putin 2012c ). Putin then stated that mutual US-Russia understanding was not helped "by regular US attempts to engage in 'political engineering, ' including in regions that are traditionally important to us and during Russian elections" (Putin 2012c) .
