 Gerasimov, Kartapolov, and Burenok) . It would not be an exaggeration to state that there has been a militarization of information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare. Furthermore, information-psychological warfare is intrinsically linked to color revolutions by its potential to destabilize the state, society, and public consciousness as well as patriotic and spiritual values.
The question is thus whether the increasing utility of informationpsychological warfare is causing a change in the Russian understanding of the nature of war. While difficult to state conclusively, this investigation suggests that this is the case. Information-psychological warfare is so effective that it should be considered violent, that it blurs the boundaries of war and peace, and that Russia considers itself to be engaged in a large-scale information war. Furthermore, it is seen as a key enabler for the creation of color revolutions, the major threat from the West in the Russian view. If these statements hold true, they are hardly compatible with the customary definition of war as defined by armed violence. Rather, its definition then would have to expand and thus lead to a change in the nature of war. Information warfare is not just changing the understanding of war in isolation-it is also seen as an integral component in the creation of color revolutions, which have become the main threat for the Russian leadership. This will be investigated in the next chapter.
