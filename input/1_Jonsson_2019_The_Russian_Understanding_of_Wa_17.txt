In general, the extent of Western analytical engagement with Russian military thought, both in terms of number of analysts and frequency of publications, has been linked to perceptions of Russian military capabilities and their use. The analysis in the late 2000s and early 2010s mostly confirmed how difficult it would be for Russia to reform, and the debate centered on Russia's military means (see, e.g., Vendil Pallin 2009; Bukkvoll 2009; Baev 2010; Renz 2010; Bartles 2011; McDermott 2011a; McDermott, Nygren, and Vendil Pallin 2012; Renz and Thornton 2012; Klein 2012; Giles 2012a ). An important exception was those Western theorists already analyzing Russian information warfare since 1996 (see Thomas 1996 Thomas , 1998 Thomas , 2001 Thomas , 2003 Thomas , 2009 Thomas , 2014;; Blank 1999 Blank , 2008a Blank , 2013;; Heicker
