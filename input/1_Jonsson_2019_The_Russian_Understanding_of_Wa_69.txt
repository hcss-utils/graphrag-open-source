This view of perpetual conflict was confirmed by Frunze, one of the most acclaimed Soviet military theorists and commissar for the army and navy in 1925, who saw that "between our proletarian state and all the rest of the bourgeois world there can be only a state of long, stubborn, desperate war to the death" (Frunze 1921, 30 ; see also Svechin 1927, 91) . Byely et al. (1972, 32) recapitulated that "wars are . . . a constant traveling companion to capitalism. "
Lenin understood war as having more utility than Marx and Engels. He held that "the victory of socialism in one country does not at one stroke eliminate all war in general. On the contrary, it presupposes wars" (Lenin 1916b, 2) . Thus, in Lenin's view, war was necessary in the condition of transforming the world and reaching the ultimate good. For Soviet leaders, "the socialistic transformation of society without an armed struggle was unconceivable" (Lider 1977, 232) . This struggle was not limited to an interstate-level; rather, it was militarizing the whole of social life (Lenin 1916b, 3) because the success of socialism in one country would not only create friction but also direct attempts by the bourgeoisie to crush the socialist state
