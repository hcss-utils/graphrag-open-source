 time on postures aimed at deterring conflict in specific contingencies. Preciously little attention is paid to the question of escalation management, which should take priority in contests between major nuclear powers. Thinking on war termination is similarly nascent. This gap is in part born of a sustained great power interregnum since World War II, but also stems from the lack of attention given this subject in the post-Cold War period.
The political leadership of any state entering a crisis with a nuclear peer will inevitably wish to be assuaged that a reasonably plausible strategy exists for escalation management and war termination. Otherwise, when faced with the potential for uncontrolled nuclear escalation, they might be self-deterred, or as the Russian leadership might suspect, vulnerable to manipulation of risk. This is especially so in cases where the US does not have vital interests at stake or is unclear about the interests at stake. Although we cannot predict what choices Russia's political leadership might make, it is less likely to be self-deterred if its military establishment has developed several plausible options for escalation management and war termination from crisis to large-scale war. These employ flexible means, many of which are usable because they are either conventional or non-forceful in nature, while others represent an iterative approach to nuclear escalation which inherently eschews the notion that it may be uncontrolled.
Hence, the Russian political leadership may consider a conflict, even against a superior adversary, as a risky but ultimately manageable affair. We do not know Russian
