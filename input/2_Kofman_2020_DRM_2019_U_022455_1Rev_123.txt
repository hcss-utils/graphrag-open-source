 determinations. At the tactical-operational level, the importance of a target is determined by its relevance to combat operations and the perceived threat derived from it, which is context based. In this sense, experts define a "critically important object" as one that will make combat operations, particularly offensives, difficult to sustain. 190 Consideration is also based on the extent to which their destruction degrades offensive potential, firepower, and the efficacy of the opponent's kill chain. 191 From a military perspective, such targets are assigned levels of damage, classified as defeat (50-60% destruction), suppression (30-35% destruction), weakening (10-15% The researcher also proposes an additional category of "unquantifiable targets." These objects could include objects important to the elites or leadership of the country, such as country homes, trade or industrial assets, or objects of specific relevance to the individuals in charge (unquantifiable targets 1, in Figure 12 ). Another subset of targets includes those objects that provide high standards of living and spiritual development-e.g., cultural centers, religious buildings, and historical monuments. These (unquantifiable targets 2, in Figure 12 , below) are meant to psychologically affect the population. 195 Broadly speaking, these two targeting strategies exist which are not mutually exclusive: targets that impact the leadership, and those that impact the civilian population. Targets within these sets are prioritized, as depicted in Figure 12 , developed by C
