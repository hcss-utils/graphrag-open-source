 the same. Their main feature-the presence of the armed struggle" (Gerasimov 2017a ). While sounding conclusive, he also added that "however, the question of the essence of war is not closed" (Gerasimov 2017a) .
That being said, Gerasimov simultaneously stated that "today, it is obvious that the line between peace and war is blurring" and that "nonmilitary forms and means of struggle have received an unprecedented technological development and acquired a dangerous and sometimes violent nature" (Gerasimov 2017a) . For him, "hybrid actions are actively used by the US and NATO countries in the international arena" and that this "emphasis in content of methods of confrontation is shifting toward the widespread use of political, economic, diplomatic, information, and other nonmilitary measures implemented with the inclusion of the protest potential of the population" (Gerasimov 2017a ). The full duality in the Russian debate can thus be captured in Gerasimov's statement. On the one hand, he wants to insist that war is defined by armed violence, but on the other he also says that unarmed means are becoming violent and that they are blurring the boundary of war and peace.
