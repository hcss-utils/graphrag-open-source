 In this way, he drew upon Trotsky, who "invented it: not peace and not war. . . . The definite border between peaceful and military international relations has been abolished" (Messner 1959, 70) . For Messner, subversion-war did not need to include physical actions; rather, as pointed out by Fridman, "The true art of subversion-war, according to Messner, involves indirect and seemingly unrelated actions that encourage internal confrontations" (Fridman 2018, 69 ).
Messner's general ideas of subverting a state and eroding its morale and values through psychological means became central in Russian military thinking in the 2010s (see chapter 4). Moreover, a number of Messner's terms (the blurring of war and peace, nonlinear war, a war of all against all, the fighting incorporating all of the population) became central topics for the understanding of war in the Russian Federation.
This chapter has found that the understanding of war in the Soviet Union came directly from the Communist Party, which was relying on Marxist-Leninist ideology, to which all military theorizing was firmly subordinated. This made the understanding of the essence of war essentially static during the existence of the Soviet Union. In analyzing war, Soviet military theorists were working in a distinct tradition based on dialectical materialism, a holistic view of politics and war, and their special focus on history, all deriving from Marxism-Leninism
