To dispel the definitional confusion, Mark Galeotti usefully argued that the debate deals with two parallel, yet overlapping, phenomena: "One is true 'hybrid war, ' the other perhaps best considered 'political war'" (Galeotti 2016a, 7 ; see also Galeotti 2016b Galeotti , 2019)) . In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by Mattis and Hoffman, which has occurred in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. That hybrid warfare was also coupled with political war, seen as "the pure use of political methods to bring about desired changes in the policy in another state" (Galeotti 2016a, 7) . A large part of the conceptual confusion stems from the fact that both of these were run in parallel (Galeotti 2016a, 7) .
The separation into hybrid war and political war is a helpful conceptual solution, but there are also problems with the term "political war" (setting aside those with hybrid war). Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for "the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives" (Kennan 1948) .
