 adversary's and international spheres. Furthermore, deterrence, in Russian usage, refers to the use of force in peacetime, in crisis and in wartime, where it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion. This probably explains why the Russian discourse does not differentiate between deterrence, compellence and coercion and uses them interchangeably or under the rubric of deterrence. This, however, more reflects the uniqueness rather than the innovativeness of the Russian approach.
The Russian discourse often uses the term 'struggle' (bor'ba) to refer to various forms of strategic interactions. For example, the military dictionary includes terms like 'informational struggle', 'radio-electronic struggle', 'diplomatic struggle', 'ideological struggle', 'economic struggle' or 'armed struggle'. 66 In Russian military theory, the term has a broad meaning and refers to strategic interaction in its totality, in both wartime and peacetime. In terms of efforts to impose one's strategic will, this binary division only refers to the intensity of the competition, but not to its essence. Competition with the adversary is seen as protracted, occurring towards, during and following kinetic phases of interaction. This is somewhat different from the Western military thought focused more on the kinetic activity. Although Russian military experts use the terms 'struggle' and 'warfare' interchangeably, the former has a meaning beyond wartime and relates to the comprehensive competition within the grand scheme of things.
