Hoffman also pointed out that the definition excludes nonmilitary means, such as economic, information, and subversive political acts, except when they are associated with terrorist and irregular tactics (Hoffman 2014 ). 3 This way of defining hybrid warfare is therefore narrow enough to be analytically useful for the military's operational analysis, but it does not capture the key elements of what made Russian warfare successful in Ukraine, nor was it meant to.
To dispel the definitional confusion, Mark Galeotti usefully argued that the debate deals with two parallel, yet overlapping, phenomena: "One is true 'hybrid war, ' the other perhaps best considered 'political war'" (Galeotti 2016a, 7 ; see also Galeotti 2016b Galeotti , 2019)) . In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by
