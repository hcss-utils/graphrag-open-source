Therefore, this definition of the essence of war does not include many of the important ways that are used to secure victory" (Byely et al. 1972, 10) . Likewise, Lider summarized this thought as follows: "Soviet scholars have traditionally laid down that war is in all epochs a continuation of politics by military means and that its essential nature does not change" (Lider 1977, 245) .
That is not, of course, to argue that there are no changes in war. Rather, what did change in every war was the particular policy governing war, how military violence was applied, and the instrumentality of war (Lider 1977, 247) .
Russian military theorists Sergei Chekinov and Sergei Bogdanov argued that the criterion of the presence or absence of war is the place and role of military and nonmilitary measures in political confrontation. If armed struggle and other actions by the armed forces predominate the business of achieving political objectives, while all other nonmilitary methods of violence work to ensure maximum effect from using armed forces, this is none other than war. Acting on this premise, political confrontation is not war if the focus is on nonmilitary means of violence, while the effect of the troops is due merely to their presence or some actions that do not involve fire and attacks, but is confined to demonstrations,
