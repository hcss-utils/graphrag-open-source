(Giles 2016b, 76) In this way, Giles suggested, the Russian understanding of war is not strictly defined by armed violence, and information warfare has expanded the understanding. This relates to the information-psychological sphere (given that states could conduct it while thinking they are innocent, as opposed to, for instance, cyberattacks). Furthermore, Giles contended, if one measures Russian actions against what Russian information theory suggests permissible in times of peace and in times of war, "recent Russian activities in the information domain would indicate that Russia already considers itself to be in a state of war" (Giles 2016b, 11) .
One way to handle the mismatch between the Western and Russian understanding of war has been to introduce the concept of the gray zone, which aims to capture the zone between war and peace (Mazarr 2015; Fitton 2016) . Gen. Joseph L. Votel, at the time head of the US Special Forces Command, and colleagues said that "the gray zone is characterized by intense political, economic, informational, and military competition more fervent in nature than normal steady-state diplomacy, yet short of conventional war" (Votel et al. 2016, 102) .
