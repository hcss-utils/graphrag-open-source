Second, characteristics of the Russian coercion paradigm are idiosyncratic, reflect a strong cultural imprint and need be analysed within the context of Russian strategic culture. Although the current Russian concept is in some respects innovative, it reflects the traditional style and remarkable historical continuity, rather than a change in the Russian strategic culture.
