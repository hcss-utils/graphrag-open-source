, experts envisioned this type of deterrence as a distant prospect and saw no non-nuclear alternative to deterring conventional aggression. 30 However, since 2008, the defence reform conventionalising the Russian military has intensified and slowly resulted in actual capacity.
In 2010, 'non-nuclear deterrence' appeared for the first time in Military Doctrine but received only a passing reference. The doctrine presumed the usage of high-precision weapons to prevent military conflicts, as part of the 'strategic deterrence activities of a forceful character'. 31 Overall, all the strategic deterrence efforts had two endsprevention of war (in peacetime) and de-escalation of conflict (in wartime), supported by forceful (military and non-military) means (political-diplomatic, legal, economic, informational-psychological and spiritual-moral).

The GS identified the creation of such a unified system, based on complex measures of both a military and nonmilitary nature, as the most important task. 32 During the years leading up to publication of the 2014 doctrine, a leap forward towards 'non-nuclear deterrence' became evident. Annual exercises since 2011 demonstrated the growing role assigned to advanced conventional munitions relative to the previous decade, when
