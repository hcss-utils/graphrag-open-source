 the Russian understanding of color revolutions among political elites and military theorists. It furthermore demonstrates how the Russian understanding of the color revolutions changed among political elites from being seen as mostly spontaneous events to a central threat to the Russian government. This is an integral part of the shift in military elites' understanding of war, which sees nonmilitary and nonviolent means becoming more important than military ones. The color revolutions were understood as a way in which Western states-in the beginning mainly the United States-could engineer regime change in hostile states with nonmilitary means. This was achieved via information warfare, NGOs, youth organizations, promotion of Western values, and diplomatic pressure. With these tools, Western states were perceived to destabilize a society, generating a popular uprising in the name of democracy that, when successful, led to citizens overthrowing their ruling regime.
At the outset of the color revolutions, they were not seen as nonmilitary warfare by Western governments. Rather, this understanding developed gradually. Among the Russian political elites from 2004 up until the 2007-8 elections in Russia, the threat of color revolutions was increasingly securitized, but it was seen to come from NGOs and the Russian opposition. When the 2007-8 elections passed without major criticism and after the "reset" between Russia and the United States in 2009, the threat subsided momentarily on the Russian agenda. This came to change with the Arab Spring and the protests during the elections in Russia 2011-12
