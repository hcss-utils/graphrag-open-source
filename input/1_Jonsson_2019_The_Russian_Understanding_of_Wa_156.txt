 enemy" (Bogdanov 2003, 3) . These are very interesting sentiments to compare to Bogdanov's later views (see below), as his focus at this time was how the use of conventional military means deliver a victory. It is furthermore worth noting that his thinking about future war is almost identical to Slipchenko's.
Similarly, Col. Sergei Chekinov, also from the Center for Military-Strategic Studies, who later coauthored several articles with Bogdanov, discussed modern wars with Col. Oleg Orekhov. Chekinov and Orekhov also explicitly drew upon Slipchenko's theories. They contended that "aerospace attack and defense are becoming . . . the main weapon of twenty-first century wars, especially in the initial period of war" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 17) . They saw that "the aerospace sphere is steadily increasing relative to actions in other spheres of armed struggle" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) . Moreover, they saw that the aerospace forces relied heavily on information and that "war acquires a qualitatively new component-information. This is due to the emergence of weapon systems based on the extensive use of information technology" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 16) . It is noteworthy that their emphasis on information is related to the application of military means rather than the information
