Hybrid warfare (gibridnaya voina) in the Russian debate is a transliteration of the English term and is used when referencing Western thought (Giles 2016a, 9 ; see also Bērzinš 2015; Giles 2015a; Monaghan 2016b; Thomas 2016a; Adamsky 2018) . Keir Giles argued "not only that the hybrid label is unhelpful and misleading but also that it gives an entirely misplaced impression of novelty" (Giles 2016a, 5) . Indeed, he pointed out that "the Armed Forces, and the capacity for intensive information warfare or subversion of the adversary, are simply two of the most important longstanding but reinvigorated instruments of [Russian state] power" (Giles 2016a, 12 ; see also Renz 2018, 161) .
