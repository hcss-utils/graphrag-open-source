 traces the intellectual history of Russian deterrence theory up to its current stage and critically discusses its essence. On the theoretical side, by analysing a case outside of Western strategic thought, which traditionally has dominated deterrence theory, the article demonstrates how strategic concepts evolve differently in various ideational contexts. By utilising cultural explanations to demonstrate the logic underpinning the Russian approach, it articulates a model of cultural imprint on deterrence conceptualisation. Finally, the article advances the study of cross-domain coercion theory. The challenges posed by Moscow's approach, which the article highlights, seem to be not unique to the Russian case but pertain to any actors engaged in cross-domain coercion and thus are generic for the purposes of theory development.
The article makes a threefold argument. The first is that the current Russian art of deterrence is an integrated whole of non-nuclear, informational and nuclear types of influence. Therefore, each component should be analysed only in the holistic context of a unified cross-domain programme. Also, this art has been constantly evolving and therefore should be understood in motion, within its intellectual history. Second, characteristics of the Russian coercion paradigm are idiosyncratic, reflect a strong cultural imprint and need be analysed within the context of Russian strategic culture. Although the current Russian concept is in some respects innovative, it reflects the traditional style and remarkable historical continuity, rather than a change in the Russian strategic culture. Finally, some aspects of the new concept may be profoundly destabilising. Although it may
