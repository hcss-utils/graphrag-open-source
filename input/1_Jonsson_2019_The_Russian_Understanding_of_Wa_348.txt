Because it believed the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 were organized on social media, the leadership increased restrictions and created its own organization (the Internet Research Agency) to combat grassroots dissent internationally. To be clear, this is not to make a justification for Russian information operations-simply to give the context in which they evolved.
The importance of information warfare, and particularly informationpsychological warfare, has become reflected among Russian military theorists and doctrines. For instance, the 2010 Military Doctrine stated that information warfare could achieve political objectives without the use of force. The 2011 Conceptual Views saw it as the armed forces' task to counter information interference in internal affairs. There has also been a notable shift among military theorists to see information-psychological as more important than armed force rather than a complement to it (e.g., Chekinov and Bogdanov; Gerasimov, Kartapolov, and Burenok) . It would not be an exaggeration to state that there has been a militarization of information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare. Furthermore, information-psychological warfare is intrinsically linked to color revolutions by its potential to destabilize the state, society, and public consciousness as well as patriotic and spiritual values.
