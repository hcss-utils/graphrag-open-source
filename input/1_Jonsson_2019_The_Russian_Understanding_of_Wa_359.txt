 directly tied to fear of color revolutions: "The link between the Orange Revolution and the urgency of passing the laws was made explicit in public comments before the laws were approved. The aim was claimed to be the elimination of the potential for Western-sponsored uprisings" (Saari 2009, 743-44) .
At the same time, the Russian government created the Civic Chamber of the Russian Federation, which was supposed to be a consultative platform for civil society to analyze draft legislation and provide oversight. However, the selection process was rigged, and the chamber was filled by pro-Kremlin activists (Greene 2014, 87) . The Civic Chamber was another way to counter the fear of opposition NGOs to give the impression that NGOs already had an influence on politics.
In discussing the potential of color revolutions, Vladimir Frolov, a political analyst, argued that Russia was facing a fundamentally new phenomenon in the post-Soviet space. In an article titled "Democracy by Remote Control, " he argued that elections in the CIS "turned into a convenient pretext for outside multilateral interference" (Frolov 2005) . Frolov saw that the outside factors consisted of a combination of Western NGOs, mass media, election observation missions, and Western countries' political leadership (Frolov 2005) . He argued that they succeeded in managing election results by declaring which ones were legitimate and which were not, acting as a "political and legal instrument for regime change"
