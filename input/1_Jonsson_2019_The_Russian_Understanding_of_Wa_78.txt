 the use of generations of warfare. The advent of a new generation was mostly seen to be driven by technology, but technological innovation alone does not suffice as a description. Rather, a revolution meant a radical change in capabilities, doctrines, and organization, so fighting took on a fundamentally different form. The most authoritative work on the subject is by Vladimir Slipchenko, whose taxonomy of warfare is still the basis for most modern Russian theorists. The first generation was 500 BC-900 AD, with hand-to-hand fighting and primitive arms. The second generation, 900-1700, featured firearms. Third-generation wars, from 1700 to 1800, were fought with increased firepower, trench warfare, and battles on the oceans. The fourth generation, from 1800 to 1945, included the advent of automatic weapons, tanks, and air battles. The fifth generation introduced nuclear weapons, which were seen by some to render political goals unachievable. The sixth generation started in 1990 and was characterized by precision weapons and information and electronic warfare; the goal was to destroy the enemy's economy with noncontact (i.e., long-distance) warfare. Slipchenko saw that warfare was just about to enter its sixth generation in the 1990s (Slipchenko 2005, 15) .
The Soviet understanding of war came directly from Lenin. He took Clausewitz's classical dictum that "war is merely a continuation of politics by other means" (
