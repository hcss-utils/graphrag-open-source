 that guides it toward behaviors advantageous to the controlling side. 201 While reflexive control is employable in the pre-conflict period, Russian articles describe it as being of maximum usefulness when a situation threatens to escalate into full military conflict, meaning that it is useful for causing an adversary to take actions advantageous to the side exercising the reflexive control during the initial period of military operations. 202 Hence, the concept is more applicable to demonstrations taken during a threatened period of conflict, particularly direct threats to vital infrastructure.
Because there are limits and complexities inherent in dealing with real people's thoughts and behaviors, and because different actions could potentially lead to opposite results (depending on the adversary), a thorough study of the target's psychology is necessary for success. 203 The strategy developed from such an analysis will be situational-i.e., it will depend on the specific conflict at hand and aimed more at affecting short-term behaviors than at affecting long-term ones. 204 Because conflicting parties make decisions based on the image of the situation available to them at a given time, and decide when to move into the military phase of conflict based on such images, the ability to manipulate and create these images can prove beneficial for adjusting an adversary's behavior and even cause it to take actions against its best interests. 205 These Russian military ideas about impacting an opponent's psychology for the purposes of escalation management require further study and attention from the US and allied analytical communities. 202 Раскин и Сорокин, "Р
