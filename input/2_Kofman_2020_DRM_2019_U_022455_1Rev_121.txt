Critically important objects are selected for actual application of deterrent damage, within the framework of strategic deterrence through use of military force. Russian military analysts developed an appreciation for the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to nonnuclear attacks in the first decade of the 2000s. For example, a 2006 Russian Academy of Sciences study argued that "conducting large-scale military conflicts with conventional and/or mass use of nuclear weapons is becoming pointless because the consequences of destroying infrastructure nodes (even singular) could lead to unexpected consequences." As examples, the study discussed the potential implications of damaging critical infrastructure such as
