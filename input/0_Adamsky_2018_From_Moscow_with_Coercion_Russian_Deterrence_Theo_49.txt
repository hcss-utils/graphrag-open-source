 contribute to a higher self-restraint. On the other hand, a critical examination of Moscow's efforts to deter and compel may take theoretical-conceptual issue with several of its aspects that seem destabilising. The findings suggest that these risks undermining strategic stability seem to emanate from the conceptual challenges that Russian strategists have not yet elaborated on, or overlooked in the nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) realms. Three challenges loom large.
The first challenge relates to coercive signalling. Deterrence failures may result from an actor's inability to signal its capability, resolve and expectations. The literature distinguishes between a 'situation of deterrence', when an actor is deterred without any message being sent, and a 'strategy of deterrence', when a deliberately crafted signal is sent. 68 In the latter case, one should not take it for granted that the deterrence signals sent to an opponent are automatically absorbed and understood. Evaluation of the signal's internalisation is crucial for avoiding threat miscommunication, the opponent's misperception and deterrence failures. How is it possible to ensure that the actors involved in, or observing, the interaction rationalise their moves correctly? How does one communicate red lines and inflict damage without escalating to a major war? Moscow repeatedly expresses genuine frustration that the West attributes to it non-existent strategic intentions in the Baltics, in Ukraine and in Syria. Also, Western responses following the Russian acts of coercion ran against Moscow's expectations and desired end states.
