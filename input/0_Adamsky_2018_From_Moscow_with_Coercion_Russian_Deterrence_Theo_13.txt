The latter started to co-opt the former systematically only beginning in the early 2000s and the concept of deterrence remained under construction. Second, Russian national strategic declarations had only a minor bearing on the actual force posture. Contradictory white papers neither reflected nor framed the intellectual and professional dynamics within the nuclear, and broader, strategic community.
