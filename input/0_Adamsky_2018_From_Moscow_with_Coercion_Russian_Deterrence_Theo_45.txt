Scholars of Russia from various disciplines argue that an inclination to holism is emblematic throughout the Russian intellectual tradition in literature, religious philosophy and the sciences. 63 It has also been projected historically on the Russian culture of war, strategic style and military thought. 64 Thus, cross-domain coercion and NGW, as the most recent version of the Russian art of strategy, essentially reflect all the features of this holistic predisposition. As such, even if innovative for the reasons outlined above, they reflect not a change but continuity in Russian strategic culture.
Western scholars sometimes see the innovativeness of the Russian approach as its being uninterrupted, in contrast to the Western division between wartime and peacetime. 65 Indeed, the Russian approach is much broader than its Western equivalent. Informational struggle is an uninterrupted strategic effort, waged during peacetime and wartime, in domestic, the adversary's and international spheres.
