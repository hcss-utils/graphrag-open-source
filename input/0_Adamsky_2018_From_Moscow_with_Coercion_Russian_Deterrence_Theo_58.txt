 in accord with earlier theoretical findings suggesting that 'theories of victory', operational art and coercion are social constructions, and their conceptualisation, consequently, has national characteristics and may differ from Western strategic theory. Although scholars should examine and measure an actor's modus operandi in a more idiosyncratic manner, they also naturally seek a sound parsimonious theory to deal with certain paradigmatic situations. For this task, an analytical framework of strategic culture and ideational explanations may be useful for clarifying puzzling operational choices and counterintuitive conceptualisations. The ability to explore and understand the interplay between national security aspirations, strategic culture and military tradition is crucial to anyone seeking to engage Moscow, or any other actor, on a host of geopolitical issues. As of this writing, however, the discipline lacks a paradigmatic consensus about cultural modes of interpreting deterrence norms and performance. The findings of this study invite a cross-cultural comparative research on the variations of deterrence conceptualisation. This topic has not yet been explored in a systematic manner and offers considerable intellectual terrain for further research.
