 "strategists and their institutions cannot be acultural and hence will continuously perceive and interpret the material realm culturally" (Poore 2003, 282) . Culture should be seen as a context from which an understanding cannot be isolated. This has been put particularly in the case of Russia as the Russian paradigm is "idiosyncratic, reflect[s] a strong cultural imprint, and need [s] to be analysed in the context of [its] strategic culture" (Adamsky 2018, 35) .
The concept of hybrid warfare became the center of the Western debate for understanding Russian warfare after the onset of the war in Ukraine. The concept has a longer history, but the use of the term before the invasion of Ukraine was not aimed at understanding Russian warfare and will therefore not be analyzed in depth here. 2 In 2014, international organizations such as NATO and the EU, as well as national governments, adopted hybrid warfare as their concept for understanding Russian contemporary warfare. At the NATO summit in Wales in September 2014, the alliance stated, "We will ensure that NATO is able to effectively address the specific challenges posed by hybrid warfare threats, where a wide range of overt and covert military, paramilitary, and civilian measures are employed in a highly integrated design" (NATO 2014) .
Since the definition includes all opposing terms, such as military, paramilitary, and civilian, as well as overt and covert, it becomes so vague
