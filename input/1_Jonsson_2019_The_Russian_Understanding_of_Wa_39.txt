This reasoning emphasized the notion that beyond nonmilitary means always being important, they are now placed at the center of the military's understanding of, and priorities in, contemporary war. Out of these, Bartles identified information means and NGOs (Bartles 2016b, 4) .
Similarly, Jakob Hedenskog, Gudrun Persson, and Carolina Vendil Pallin saw three distinct drivers of Russian threat perception: color revolutions, the "besieged fortress" perception, and the struggle over values (Hedenskog, Persson, and Vendil Pallin 2016, 97) . The fear of popular uprisings was "central for the understanding of the Russian view of modern conflicts" (Hedenskog, Persson, and Vendil Pallin 2016, 110) . They concluded that the Russian leadership sees color revolutions as a form of aggression from the West against Russia and that "non-military means are given a fundamental role in contemporary and future conflict, " among which the information sphere was particularly important (Hedenskog, Persson, and Vendil Pallin 2016, 114-15, 121-22
