 but also to influence the opponent's behaviour in other fields of activity, including kinetic operations. 'Informational pressure' on the adversary, its armed forces, state apparatus, citizens and world public opinion also produces favourable conditions for other forms of coercion. 50 Because there is no clear division of labour in the sphere of informational struggle, multiple organisations competing for resources and responsibilities within the Russian strategic community promote theory development. In the main, this discussion tends to blur any distinction between the electronic and cyber forms of informational struggle, up to their full convergence. 51 This, in turn, stimulates exploration of the digital-technological aspects of informational deterrence. Avenues of future research on the 'dialectics of deterrence' in the cyber realm, which GS experts designated in 2016, exemplify several conceptualpractical deficits in this realm. The experts call for evaluation of unacceptable damage that deters the opponent and targets selection criteria; the joint employment of cyber and conventional capabilities to optimise coercion; the formulation of an 'adequate understanding' among the adversary's decision makers of the resolve to use cyber capabilities and their effectiveness. 52 
How do these three forms of influence relate to each other? The term crossdomain coercion is probably the best description of the Russian art of orchestrating non-nuclear, informational and nuclear influence within a unified programme, which sometimes features in Russian writing as 'strategic deterrence'. The mechanism of this approach that has manifested itself during the recent Russian gambits
