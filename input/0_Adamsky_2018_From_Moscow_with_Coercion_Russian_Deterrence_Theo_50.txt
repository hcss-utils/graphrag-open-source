 threat miscommunication, the opponent's misperception and deterrence failures. How is it possible to ensure that the actors involved in, or observing, the interaction rationalise their moves correctly? How does one communicate red lines and inflict damage without escalating to a major war? Moscow repeatedly expresses genuine frustration that the West attributes to it non-existent strategic intentions in the Baltics, in Ukraine and in Syria. Also, Western responses following the Russian acts of coercion ran against Moscow's expectations and desired end states. The Russian approach presumes signalling, including by intensifying pressure across all domains, to communicate Russian resolve and capability, but the question remains, as Kristin Ven Bruusgaard poses, 'whether the adversary will understand the message of deterrence the way the Russian concept prescribes it'. 69 Experts today lack solid evidence that Russia possesses any framework to estimate that its signalling has been grasped correctly. Comprehensible signalling and verification that signals have been absorbed and perceived as intended is a vital, but possibly sometimes missing, part of the Russian approach.
This issue is linked to the evaluation challenge. How does one establish the effectiveness of one's deterrence programme on an opponent's decision-making? Available sources on the Russian professional discourse do not indicate that this procedure has been properly conceptualised and institutionalised either. Russian planners possibly assume that deterrence has been achieved when the operational plan has been fully executed, or take desired strategic behaviour by the opponent as confirmation of the plan's effectiveness. However, the evaluation
