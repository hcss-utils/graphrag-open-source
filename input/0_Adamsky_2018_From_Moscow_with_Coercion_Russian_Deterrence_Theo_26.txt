Believing that non-nuclear means (precision weapons, ballistic and cruise missiles) and informational (cyber) capabilities generate battlefield and deterrence effects compatible with nuclear weapons, Russian experts, more than before, emphasised deterrence as a function of non-nuclear, hard and soft instruments. 33 Leading up to the events in Ukraine, an assumption emerged in the Russian strategic community that the relevance of nuclear deterrence is limited to a very narrow set of scenarios, unless it is skilfully synthesised with other forms of coercion.
