 predictable, whether it is seeking to inflict "deterrent damage" in efforts to manage escalation or "assigned damage" in warfighting.
Russian thinking is increasingly clear on the role and utility of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including the timing of their employment and their likely targets. Russian writings offer a good glimpse into when, how, and against what targets nuclear weapons might be used. Russian deliberations on the threat posed by theater US missile defense to these calibrated escalation approaches also telegraph one of the likely potential counters to single or grouped strikes. In general, the US should seek to deter specific escalation approaches either by shaping the means the Russian military intend to use, the resilience of the targets their stratagem seeks to attack, or their confidence levels.
Russian military strategies offer important insights into potential triggers for escalation, thresholds which the adversary believes relevant for transition in either the period of conflict or the type of war they are fighting. These are useful in considering US escalation management strategies. How the US chooses to employ its own "strategic conventional" arsenal will prove of immense consequence in the Russian leadership's selection of their available courses of action. US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.
Similarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory
