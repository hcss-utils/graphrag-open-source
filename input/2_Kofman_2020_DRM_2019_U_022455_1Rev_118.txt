such that the military campaign can no longer be sustained in theater. The ability of these forces to carry out strategic operations, that is their viability to succeed in a strategic aerospace operation or SODCIT, may constitute one of the criteria Russian military science uses to determine whether or not to escalate to nuclear use.
Precision-guided weapons-together with new means of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance-have afforded the Russian military the ability to target key elements of an adversary's critical infrastructure. The emphasis is placed on targets whose destruction has the potential to create cascading effects on the system as a whole. The ultimate point of using conventional weapons against particular types of critical targets is to affect escalation management, creating a specific level of psychological coercion that will convince an adversary of the futility of further conflict, given any continued or potential escalation in damage. Of course targets may, and likely will, include those that have both a deterrent effect and practical military value should the conflict continue; that is, there are targets which may be considered dual purpose.
Military writings generally divide targets based on their strategic significance and collateral effects. For example, "vitally important objects" are understood to be targets the damage to which leads to significant economic losses and population loss (such as hazardous industries, hydrocarbon facilities, and hydro and nuclear power plants). 180
