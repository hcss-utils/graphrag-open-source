 of unacceptable consequences produced by this crossdomain coercion should paralyse the adversary's assertiveness and responsiveness.
Uninterrupted informational deterrence waged on all possible fronts against all possible audiences, augmented by nuclear signalling and supplemented by intra-war coercion, constitutes an integrated cross-domain operation. The main rationale of this operation is to dissuade the adversary from aggression or to deescalate it and impose Russia's will with minimal violence. The amalgamation of different tools of cross-domain coercion ensures that the limitations of each form of influence are compensated by other capabilities, in peacetime, in crisis and in wartime. When in a certain scenario, the effectiveness of one type of influence, for example nuclear, diminishes; it is supplemented by other types of coercion that could be employed in a more pressing manner including actual use of force. This ensures flexibility and effectiveness that each tool by itself cannot provide and capitalises on the Russian competitive advantage over the West to operate and shape reality across several domains. 53 
How innovative is the Russian cross-domain coercion approach? How does it diverge from previous Russian practice? The main novelty is that in essence, this approach is not a brute force but a coercion strategy. In contrast to traditional massive use of force, cross-domain coercion aims at manipulating the adversary's perception, decision-making and behaviour. This notion lies at the heart of NGW, which orchestrates the military and non-military measures while minimising kinetic engagements. Since Russian usage of the term 'deter
