Rather, the most notable shift in the Russian understanding of war came in the period 2012-14. Thereafter, the most central political elites and military theorists expressed the view that war was going through a fundamental transformation because nonmilitary means were so effective that they should be considered violent, the boundary of war and peace was blurring, nonmilitary means were becoming four times as important as military means, representing their own form of warfare, and the effectiveness of nonmilitary means constituted a cardinal change in the concept of war and its knowledge system (Putin 2012a; Gerasimov 2013; Gareyev 2013b; Gerasimov 2014a; Chekinov and Bogdanov 2016) .
