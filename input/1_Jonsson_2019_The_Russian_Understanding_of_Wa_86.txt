Byely et al. 1972, 8) . Concomitantly, war was then understood as the continuation of class politics by violent means. This became the central definition of war in the Soviet Union.
Soviet theorists were keen to distinguish themselves from Clausewitz in another sense too. In their view, Clausewitz's description of war as an instrument of politics was both incorporated into Soviet thought but also criticized, as it implied that war was the result of voluntary decisions (Lider 1977, 249) . Marx had "shown the folly of such a view by demonstrating that behavior is rooted in the material base, that is in the system of production and the socio-economic structure" (Lider 1977, 249) . In other words, the Clausewitzian view of war failed to acknowledge the automaticity in Soviet thought, in which the material base inevitably led to wars.
Up until the 1960s, Soviet military theorist Aleksandr Kalistratov saw broad agreement to treat armed conflict and war synonymously; war meant a "social armed struggle" or "an armed struggle in a class society" (Kalistratov 2004, 150) . Prominent Soviet military theorist Vasily Sokolovsky argued in his seminal book Voyennaya strategiya (Military strategy) that war could be defined as armed violence between different groups for political goals (Sokolovsky 1963, 271) .
