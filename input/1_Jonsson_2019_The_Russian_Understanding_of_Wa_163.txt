A change in Gareyev's thought can nonetheless be noted regarding color revolutions. He contended that world wars and large-scale aggressions against Russia were becoming increasingly unlikely, both due to the existence of nuclear weapons and the growing utility of new forms of achieving political and strategic objectives (Gareyev 2005a ). Due to the unlikelihood of large-scale wars, he held that "other ways of achieving political objectives have been devised: economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and information warfare. One country after another can be bent into submission using subversive means from within" (Gareyev 2005c, 66) . The effectiveness of these means could have been seen in Serbia in the 1990s and in Georgia's Rose Revolution, Gareyev added (Gareyev 2005a) . Moreover, he argued that even if these nonmilitary forms of struggle have been present throughout history, it is only now that their utility has increased significantly in proportion to military means (Gareyev 2005a ).
