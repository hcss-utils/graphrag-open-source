What is even more striking is that the Soviets were able to place these innovations in a much deeper and broader context, reflecting a far more profound grasp of these developments' implications than the West itself possessed.\n-Dima Adamsky (2010, 32) M any of the particular features of Russian military thought today have roots in Soviet military thought. This is probably unsurprising since the majority of the elites in today's Russia were educated and had their early careers under the Soviet system. The influence, however, goes further. Some of the key debates in contemporary Russia regarding what war is-including the US military's MTR\/RMA, which later became network-centric warfare (NCW)-originated in Soviet times. Furthermore, many of the characteristics that set Russian military thought apart from its Western equivalent, such as the reliance on holism and dialectical materialism, were also introduced during the Soviet period. Soviet military theorists and political elites had a different way of approaching military thought, and arguably it was deeper and broader than Western approaches, as the quote above emphasizes.\nThe body of military theory and authoritative views was exceptionally stable throughout the history of the Soviet Union.

The key part of this was that it could be done without armed violence. Bruntalsky concluded that he was in fundamental agreement with Maltsev that modern conditions had radically transformed the nature of war (Bruntalsky 2007) . He saw that because of spiritual, political, economic, and other forms of repression and destruction of the enemy, \"armed struggle is not always the determining factor of paramount importance and can be eliminated altogether\" (Bruntalsky 2007) .

He argued that if one understood war like Bruntalsky and Maltsev, the collapse of the Soviet Union would be \"the result of a certain victory of the aggressor in a war of some nonclassical 'nth' generation\" and thus an \"unprecedented violation from an aggressor (aggressors) of all the foundations of international law\" (Brezkun 2007) .

Competition with the adversary is seen as protracted, occurring towards, during and following kinetic phases of interaction. This is somewhat different from the Western military thought focused more on the kinetic activity. Although Russian military experts use the terms 'struggle' and 'warfare' interchangeably, the former has a meaning beyond wartime and relates to the comprehensive competition within the grand scheme of things.\nThe closest Western approximation to the Russian notions of 'struggle' and 'strategic deterrence', defined here as 'cross-domain coercion', is probably the concept of 'competitive strategy'. This approach envisions interaction as the long-term competition that takes place in both peace and war and is not the same as actual military fighting.

Marxism-Leninism was not only the methodological foundation for military strategy but also provided a whole worldview, which military strategy had to reflect. When the Soviet ideology disappeared, a vehicle to replace it was the introduction of three new documents of security policy: the National Security Concept of the Russian Federation, the Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation, and the Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, with the National Security Concept superior (De Haas 2010, 4). However, the National Security Concept was the last document of these three to be produced in 1997. The delay was the consequence of initial uncertainty over whether the concept was to cover the whole of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) or just the Russian Federation, as well as a power struggle between the departments involved (De Haas 2010, 6) . The Military Doctrine was drafted singlehandedly by the Ministry of Defense (and approved by the Security Council), and the Foreign Policy Concept by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which made them quicker to produce.\nThe 1993 Military Doctrine was broadly in line with the view of war from Soviet times from the last edition of The Soviet Military Encyclopedia, published just seven years earlier. The Military Doctrine noted that the main sources of external military danger to the Russian Federation were local wars, territorial claims against Russia, internal destabilization, and international

This thus put Kirshin on both sides of the argument: He saw that Clausewitz's definition of war was too narrow but simultaneously maintained that it should remain.\nIn December 2013, Chekinov and Bogdanov published an article titled \"The Nature and Content of a New-Generation War, \" which became widely circulated among Western analysts after the onset of the war in Ukraine. Some even saw it as a blueprint for Russian contemporary warfare. The way the authors envisioned contemporary warfare did indeed sound like a good description of the initial phase of the Crimean operation:\nThe aggressive side will be first to use nonmilitary actions and measures as it plans to attack its victim in a new-generation war. With powerful information technologies at its disposal, the aggressor will make an effort to involve all public institutions in the country it intends to attack, primarily the mass media and religious organizations, cultural institutions, non-governmental organizations, public movements financed from abroad, and scholars engaged in research on foreign grants.

On the one hand, he maintained that the essence of war remained as Clausewitz had defined it. On the other, he criticized this very understanding of armed violence as the defining factor of war and proposed a definition whereby war could be perpetrated solely by nonmilitary means.\nDuring the 2000s, Gareyev maintained his traditional view of primary importance given to armed conflict as the defining factor of war and an insistence on Clausewitzian concepts, such as the value of morale. In 2003, he addressed the increasing importance of nonmilitary means, arguing that \"non-military means, especially information means, greatly affect the nature of armed struggle yet armed forces and violence are the main typical features of any war\" (Gareyev 2003a, 187) .

In a discussion at the Military Science Society, he stated that even though \"the artificial milieu, or human technology, in the broad sense of the word, has transfigured war just as it has transfigured all other human relations . . . this most general basis [of war] remains unchanged. In other words, war is a hostile encounter between human groups equipped with instruments for killing and destroying, with the direct aim of winning physical dominance over the enemy\" (Trotsky 1922) .\nTrotsky thus emphasized the physically violent aspect of war and, like Clausewitz, supported the notion that war's nature remains while the ways of fighting change. Trotsky continued to argue that war needed to have social organization and political objectives, otherwise it would merely be animals killing each other (Trotsky 1922 ). Another affinity with Clausewitz was that Trotsky saw \"the task of war [as being] to destroy the enemy's manpower. This can be achieved by means of a blow\" (Trotsky 1922) .

The Ukrainian organizations Pora and Znayu held seminars on their experiences and techniques from the Orange Revolution with Russian youth organizations that the United States and European states funded (Schwirtz 2007, 74) .

A flexible response meant that NATO would first have met aggression with conventional means and then, if this proved unsuccessful, with nuclear means.

The most significant change in the doctrine was the changed wording regarding the use of nuclear weapons. The 1997 concept stated that they could be used in the case of an existential threat, whereas the 2000 concept stated that all means, including nuclear, would be used against an armed aggressor (Main 2000) .\nSeven years after the first Military Doctrine, another was adopted. The new doctrine maintained some of the optimism of the former by, for instance, stating that positive changes in the international situation, the peace-loving foreign-policy course of Russia, and its nuclear deterrent capability had decreased the threat of direct military aggression against Russia (Ministry of Defense 2000, point I.4). In terms of the view of war, the 2000 Military Doctrine was less clear. It continued, like the 1993 doctrine, to explain war with armed conflict in parentheses. It noted that \"the nature of modern wars and armed conflicts is determined by their military-political goals, the means of achieving these goals, and the scale of military operations\" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.2).\nIn the paragraph describing modern wars, the doctrine reads","chunk_id":"38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac","document_ids":["09e6744e38888b1d7ac2a999ec64da2d"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"RUSSIAN FEDERATION\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Russian Federation is the subject of the Military Doctrine discussed in the text.\"","source_id":"38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac"},{"name":"\"MILITARY DOCTRINE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Military Doctrine refers to a set of principles and guidelines governing military strategy and operations.\"","source_id":"38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac"},{"name":"\"1997 VERSION\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The 1997 version of the Military Doctrine is mentioned as a predecessor to the 2000 version.\"","source_id":"38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac"},{"name":"\"2000 VERSION\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The 2000 version of the Military Doctrine is the focus of the text, highlighting its changes and perspectives.\"","source_id":"38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN FEDERATION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Russian Federation is the subject of the Military Doctrine discussed in the text.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;MILITARY DOCTRINE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Military Doctrine refers to a set of principles and guidelines governing military strategy and operations.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;1997 VERSION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The 1997 version of the Military Doctrine is mentioned as a predecessor to the 2000 version.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;2000 VERSION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The 2000 version of the Military Doctrine is the focus of the text, highlighting its changes and perspectives.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">38a5a22d04aa221997f0aa343f0a29ac<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Maltsev argued that treating these types of war as simply combat support would be to \"behave classically in a nonclassical situation\" and would fail (Bruntalsky 2007) .

In the sphere of state security, the activity of security services and organizations of foreign countries were listed as the first threat, and listed later were organizations and structures that were destabilizing the social or political situation in Russia (President of the Russian Federation 2009, point 37). Another noteworthy point was the call for the rebirth and preservation of cultural\/moral values and more spiritual unity (President of the Russian Federation 2009, point 84).

On the theoretical side, by analysing a case outside of Western strategic thought, which traditionally has dominated deterrence theory, the article demonstrates how strategic concepts evolve differently in various ideational contexts. By utilising cultural explanations to demonstrate the logic underpinning the Russian approach, it articulates a model of cultural imprint on deterrence conceptualisation. Finally, the article advances the study of cross-domain coercion theory. The challenges posed by Moscow's approach, which the article highlights, seem to be not unique to the Russian case but pertain to any actors engaged in cross-domain coercion and thus are generic for the purposes of theory development.\nThe article makes a threefold argument. The first is that the current Russian art of deterrence is an integrated whole of non-nuclear, informational and nuclear types of influence. Therefore, each component should be analysed only in the holistic context of a unified cross-domain programme. Also, this art has been constantly evolving and therefore should be understood in motion, within its intellectual history. Second, characteristics of the Russian coercion paradigm are idiosyncratic, reflect a strong cultural imprint and need be analysed within the context of Russian strategic culture. Although the current Russian concept is in some respects innovative, it reflects the traditional style and remarkable historical continuity, rather than a change in the Russian strategic culture. Finally, some aspects of the new concept may be profoundly destabilising.

However, in other security-related aspects, the strategy offered less optimism. It affirmed that the imperfect nature of international mechanisms was a threat to international security, as was the one-sided use of force in international relations. Furthermore, the strategy saw that threats to military security include the policies of a number of leading foreign countries directed at achieving predominant superiority in the military sphere, primarily in terms of strategic nuclear forces but also by developing high-precision, information, and other high-technology means of conducting armed warfare, i.e., strategic nonnuclear arms, by unilaterally creating a global missile defense system and militarizing space, which could lead to a new arms race, and likewise policies directed at the proliferation of nuclear, chemical, and biological technologies, and the production of weapons of mass destruction, their delivery systems, or components.

Svechin saw that the political conflict that pervades all human existence is usually conducted within the framework of conditions set by ruling classes-that is, within a legal framework. However, there are times when a situation is created in which this conflict turns into violence. If we are discussing foreign policy, this means that standards of international law have been violated, and the offended party, if it possesses sufficient strength, it is not always limited to a mere protest, and a political conflict takes the form of war. If we are discussing domestic politics, then the resort to violence by a nonruling class or nonruling nationality becomes a civil war.

On the one hand, he wants to insist that war is defined by armed violence, but on the other he also says that unarmed means are becoming violent and that they are blurring the boundary of war and peace.\nThe 2010 Military Doctrine applied five different concepts to describe war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and largescale war (each clearly defined in the introduction). \"Military conflict\" was a general term that encompassed all the others. \"Armed conflict\" meant an armed clash on a limited scale. A \"local war\" referred to states pursuing limited military goals with military action that primarily affects those states. \"Regional war\" was seen to have more important aims, and both conventional and nuclear means could be involved, as well as air, sea, or space operations. Finally, \"large-scale war\" included a significant number of states that pursued radical military-political goals (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.6d-h). The Military Doctrine stated that military conflicts are defined by their objectives and the forms and methods of struggle (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.11 ). This appears similar to the view of Gareyev, who reasoned that it is the method that distinguishes the perpetration of war from warfare (perhaps unsurprising, as Gareyev was one of the authors of the doctrine).\n","chunk_id":"26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816","document_ids":["0ecaa27007a71a4edc6df3160df36e6d"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"GERASIMOV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Gerasimov is a Russian military figure who argues that war is defined by armed violence but also acknowledges the blurring lines between war and peace due to unarmed means.\"","source_id":"26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816"},{"name":"\"MILITARY DOCTRINE\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The Military Doctrine of 2010 outlines five concepts of war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and large-scale war.\"","source_id":"26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816"},{"name":"\"GAREYEV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Gareyev is a Russian military figure who contributed to the 2010 Military Doctrine and believes that the method distinguishes war from warfare.\"","source_id":"26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;GERASIMOV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Gerasimov is a Russian military figure who argues that war is defined by armed violence but also acknowledges the blurring lines between war and peace due to unarmed means.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;MILITARY DOCTRINE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Military Doctrine of 2010 outlines five concepts of war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and large-scale war.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;GAREYEV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Gareyev is a Russian military figure who contributed to the 2010 Military Doctrine and believes that the method distinguishes war from warfare.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816<\/data>    <\/node>    <edge source=\"&quot;GERASIMOV&quot;\" target=\"&quot;MILITARY DOCTRINE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Gerasimov's statement reflects on the concepts of war presented in the 2010 Military Doctrine.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">26bcdb76c6596b963d2e36a4147ef816<\/data>    <\/edge>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

Second, asymmetrical and indirect actions of a political, economic, informational and technological nature neutralise the adversary's military superiority. 'Indirect strategy' is primarily about using the informational struggle to neutralise the adversary without, or with minimal, employment of force.

{"id":"3858893d4e6c348056e49fd3ae011704","chunk":" unequivocal authoritative statement that war is no longer defined solely by armed violence or the threat thereof. However, this should not be expected, and such a declaration would have significant consequences. First, the concept of armed attack and armed violence is the basis of international law as well as the Russian federal law On Defense, which regulates the use of the armed forces. Such recognition would, given the Russian leadership's perception of these means as ongoing, mean that Russia now would be in a state of war.\nThis argument has direct implications for handling the conflict with Russia-something the West often struggles with. One example is how the US and EU sanctions on Russia after the start of the war in Ukraine were seen in the West as a way to avoid escalation, whereas the Russian leadership claimed they were a form of warfare to provoke regime change (Reuters 2014) . This emphasizes the difficulties that the West has with handling escalation with Russia. Measures such as sanctions are meant to signal that Russian actions are unacceptable, but the West also tends to think that they avoid escalation. However, they are often contrarily seen by the Russian leadership as escalation, although by nonmilitary means. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, \"Russia believes itself to be in a war with the West, albeit, for now, a non-military one\" (Jonsson 2017a) .

Russian experts argued until recently that they lacked methodology for calculating an unacceptable level of damage above which the nuclear threshold would be crossed. As of fall 2015, this critical threshold remained undefined. Russian military theoreticians demand the adoption of 'modified McNamara criteria' and the introduction of a procedure for the calculation of prospective and actual damage to critical social-military-economic infrastructure and to political-military command-and-control systems under conventional aggression. 72 Criteria and methodology became very relevant in the case of intra-war coercion that involves escalation dominance and a decision to cross the nuclear threshold in the midst of conventional hostilities, especially when different forms of strategic influence are interconnected and employed simultaneously. This is particularly worrisome in the realm of informational (cyber) struggle, 73 where Russian practitioners do not seem to possess a method for 'direct and indirect battlefield damage assessment'. 74 In sum, these three deficits of the Russian approach put Moscow in danger of pushing itself over the 'culminating point'. Moscow, like strategic communities elsewhere, seeks to signal or act coercively strong enough to maintain, restore or establish new norms of an opponent's strategic behaviour, but without escalation.

The fundamental difference consisted in the distance at which the fighting took place, due to long-range and high-precision weapons. This was seen to change the nature of fighting and enable a win without coming into direct contact with the enemy. Nonetheless, Konyzhev and Sergunin concluded in their discussion that its popularity has waned since the 1990s and 2000s due to both the demonstrable need for ground troops in Afghanistan and Iraq and the fact that Slipchenko predicted that war would have fully entered the noncontact generation by this time (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 90) .

The 2010 Military Doctrine also saw that information warfare was so effective that it could reach strategic objectives by itself, without the need for armed force. The security doctrines list threats from a civilizational level, interference and destabilization that lead to overthrow of leadership, as well as information warfare and foreign powers using the protest potential of the population. The 2015 National Security Strategy explicitly referred to color revolutions in its threat perception. While none of the security doctrines has explicitly rejected the traditional understanding of war as defined by armed violence (the federal law On Defense understands war as being defined by armed violence), there has been a clear shift between 1993 to today.\nThe foremost factors in changing this understanding have been the increased importance of information warfare and the fear of color revolutions. They are interrelated, and information warfare is perceived to be crucial for the impact of the society to that leads to revolt, destabilizing the Russian state and military.

The doctrines hold formal status as the basis for national security planning. Moreover, following Soviet tradition, these doctrines are useful to analyze because they go far beyond Western ones in terms of what questions they answer and their military-theoretical depth and detail. The military doctrines not only direct the armed forces but the whole of the state's organization for war (voyennoye organisatsiya gosudarstvo).\nThe statements of the political elites are important as they reveal perceptions of war among those in power. A drawback of analyzing the political elites' statements is that they are less likely to venture into depth on military issues or have a military-theoretical foundation. Among the political elites, particular weight is given to the president, the minister of defense, and the head of the Security Council. The military theorists are crucial as they have the militarytheoretical expertise to analyze how war is changing.

It fails to account for the challenge of controlled escalation stratagems employed by adversaries, the prospect that an adversary's plan for cost imposition or systemic destruction might prove effective, and the risk of uncontrolled escalation resulting from misperceptions.\nBy understanding the assumptions and targeting requirements involved in Russian planning for escalation management, US planners could invest better in defense, resilience, and approaches that would alter the adversary's calculus. In any strategy, the other side gets a vote. Presumably the Russian military must force-generate assets during different periods of escalation, making both the forces involved and their potential targets predictable, whether it is seeking to inflict \"deterrent damage\" in efforts to manage escalation or \"assigned damage\" in warfighting.\nRussian thinking is increasingly clear on the role and utility of nonstrategic nuclear weapons, including the timing of their employment and their likely targets. Russian writings offer a good glimpse into when, how, and against what targets nuclear weapons might be used. Russian deliberations on the threat posed by theater US missile defense to these calibrated escalation approaches also telegraph one of","chunk_id":"0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1","document_ids":["19c18ce82cf898229fc29c93c40c6050"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"RUSSIAN MILITARY\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The text discusses the Russian military's planning for escalation management and warfighting capabilities.\"","source_id":"0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1"},{"name":"\"US PLANNERS\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"US planners are mentioned as needing to understand Russian escalation management assumptions.\"","source_id":"0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1"},{"name":"\"RUSSIAN WRITINGS\"","type":"\"TEXT\"","description":"\"Russian writings provide insights into their nuclear weapon employment strategies.\"","source_id":"0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN MILITARY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The text discusses the Russian military's planning for escalation management and warfighting capabilities.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;US PLANNERS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"US planners are mentioned as needing to understand Russian escalation management assumptions.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN WRITINGS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"TEXT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Russian writings provide insights into their nuclear weapon employment strategies.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">0283cd403b9606c59770ad6284698bd1<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

A flexible response meant that NATO would first have met aggression with conventional means and then, if this proved unsuccessful, with nuclear means. Until 1968, Soviet military doctrine maintained that a world war (if unleashed by the imperialists) would inevitably lead to a war where the main forms of combat were nuclear (Scott and Scott 1982, 158) . After NATO's change in strategic concept, Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii acknowledged that there could be combat actions that did not necessarily involve the use of nuclear weapons (Scott and Scott 1982, 207) .\nSeeing war as inevitable and peace as a mere pause between wars has implications for how war is viewed ethically, which is another aspect of the understanding of war. War was viewed positively in the Soviet Union in the sense that it could speed up the transformation of the world into communism (the ultimate goal of the Soviet regime). This built on an idea from Marx, who stated that war was \"the midwife helping the birth of a new society from the loins of the old order\" (Fedotoff- White 1936, 326) . The Soviet way of classifying just and unjust wars was manifold and changed over time, but the essence of the view in Soviet ideology was straightforward: Soviet wars were just, and imperialist wars were not.

In terms of nonmilitary measures, General Baluyevsky (author of the 2010 and 2014 doctrine) called for a system of military-political, scientific, research, militarytechnical, and other measures to protect national interests (NVO 2014). This agrees with Adamsky's description of Russian deterrence as going through three intellectual waves, developed in two time periods. The first time period and wave was from 1991 to 2010 and focused on nuclear deterrence, whereas the second period was from 2010 onward and was oriented toward nonnuclear and information deterrence (Adamsky 2018, 34) . This division captured the increasing emphasis on nonnuclear deterrence.\nThe most important change was the increased focus on nonmilitary and information aspects of military conflict. The first point under the heading \"Characteristics of Modern Military Conflict\" was \"the integrated use of military force, political, economic, information, and other measures of nonmilitary nature through the extensive use of the population's protest potential and special operations forces\" (Ministry of Defense 2014, point II.15a).

This is the sense in which this book understands the nature of war.

He stated that war has been \"understood as the continuation of politics by means of armed violence\" and that this was how war is interpreted in the law On Defense (Gareyev 2017 ). However, Gareyev saw that \"now, when the scope and technological opportunities of nonmilitary means of confrontation have significantly expanded, it is increasingly being asked whether their use means aggression\" (Gareyev 2017) . Therefore, Gareyev argued that wartime laws, or their interpretation, needed to be changed (Gareyev 2017) .\nGareyev saw that scholars in the Russian debate had started to divide the definition of war into the traditional one-the use of armed violence (nasiliya)and the nontraditional one, which involved nonmilitary means (Gareyev 2017 ; see also Gareyev 2018) . Therefore, Gareyev called for a clarification of the definition of the essence of war, which should be done together by the Academy of Military Sciences and the Foreign Ministry, whose results were to be sent to the UN (Gareyev 2017) .

Therefore, the Military Doctrine was updated after only four years.\nThe 2014 doctrine followed the main strands set out in 2010, including the divisions of military and armed conflict and local, regional, and large-scale war. Nonetheless, there were a number of areas where the new doctrine went further. The first was that the doctrine painted a more negative image of international relations. Similar to the Foreign Policy Concept, the 2014 doctrine saw that global competition was on the rise, including rivalry within values and models of developments, whereas the 2010 doctrine stated that ideological confrontation was weakening (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.7, 9; 2014, point II.9).\nAnother novelty was the need for a nonnuclear deterrence.

The doctrine presumed the usage of high-precision weapons to prevent military conflicts, as part of the 'strategic deterrence activities of a forceful character'. 31 Overall, all the strategic deterrence efforts had two endsprevention of war (in peacetime) and de-escalation of conflict (in wartime), supported by forceful (military and non-military) means (political-diplomatic, legal, economic, informational-psychological and spiritual-moral). Back then, however, Russia lacked a unified system of strategic deterrence (codified theory, methodological apparatus and procedures supporting it), as well as a coordinating organ to orchestrate it across all domains.

A key part of the West's approach was through information means, and the Arab Spring \"confirmed Russian perceptions of social media as a dangerous and destabilising tool of Russia's enemies\" (Giles 2016b, 43) .\nThe 2013-14 Euromaidan revolt further cemented the view of the color revolutions as a successful tool of Western states and a major threat for Russia-a view that had solidified by late 2014. In the Russian government, \"there is a clear perception that Russia is one of the main targets\" (Gorenburg 2014, 2) . Likewise, Peter Duncan concluded in his study that \"at least some people at the highest levels of the regime had a genuine fear that there might be a colored revolution in Russia, financed by and supported from the West\" (Duncan 2013, 20) .

Confusion has amplified the anxiety about the novel Russian modus operandi and the strategic theory that underlies it. In Ukraine, Syria and the Baltics, Moscow practised coercion by merging military and non-military forms of influence across nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) domains. Western experts have been impressed and concerned by the scale of application and effectiveness of the Russian approach, which this article dubs 'cross-domain coercion', and have made its understanding essential for international policy and theory. What is the mechanism of the Russian art of coercion? How innovative and unique is it? How does the Russian case inform formal models of deterrence? These are the questions this article addresses.\nCross-domain coercion is the recent evolution in the Russian art of strategy, and one of the instruments of Russian policy. It evolved through three waves of intellectual activity, and out of the continuous effort by the Russian strategic community to transform itself in accordance with its understanding of the changing character of war. The first wave focused on nuclear deterrence, the second scrutinised conventional deterrence and the third explored informational (cyber) deterrence. Eventually, three waves merged into the current cross-domain coercion vision. Chronologically, this evolution had two periods. The first period, from 1991 till the 2010, emphasised nuclear weapons in deterring conventional aggressionthe first wave of theory.

How does one establish the effectiveness of one's deterrence programme on an opponent's decision-making? Available sources on the Russian professional discourse do not indicate that this procedure has been properly conceptualised and institutionalised either. Russian planners possibly assume that deterrence has been achieved when the operational plan has been fully executed, or take desired strategic behaviour by the opponent as confirmation of the plan's effectiveness. However, the evaluation of deterrence effectiveness and the requirement of a proven causal link, as opponents' behaviour may be a function of considerations unrelated to Moscow's actions, do not feature prominently in Russian publications. Lacking an established analytical mechanism to systematically assess how a coercion programme impacts the strategic calculus of the opponent, Moscow may take a correlation between its moves and an opponent's desirable behaviour for causality and interpret it as coercion success.\nThe current corpus of Russian literature does not explore thoroughly the subject of inadvertent escalation resulting from misinterpretation of signalling.

First, he is the highestranking officer in the Russian Armed Forces, and the General Staff leads the military-theoretical debate. This makes him the utmost authority on militarytheoretical matters. Second, Gerasimov's view of war argued what Gareyev only hinted at. If well-orchestrated attempts by external actors to influence nations with nonmilitary means are seen as equivalent to war, then the world could, indeed, be said to be in a more or less continual state of war. This has the consequence that the regulatory function of the dichotomy of war and peace, of permitting and restricting means, has to give way. This was arguably why Gerasimov saw the boundary of war and peace blurring. Third, many of the ideas contained in Gerasimov's speech did not originate with him. Rather, as above, the idea that the nature of war is changing, that the boundaries of war and peace are blurring, and that color revolutions are becoming the West's main form of warfare have well-established precedents in the Russian debate.

Rather, a common way to handle the paradox of defining war by armed violence and the increasing utility of nonmilitary means has been to introduce new concepts. Examples include nonmilitary war, wars of controlled chaos, unconventional warfare, information warfare, hybrid warfare, subversion-war, and wars of consciousness. Similarly, the adaptive approach to the use of force as proposed by Gerasimov (and relied on by others) sees the West's primary use of force as nonmilitary and nonviolent and traditional military force as the backup option. In this way, introducing a new concept, such as nonmilitary war, is a way to reconcile the changes taking place in the Russian understanding of war without having to go against the long-held axiom that the nature of war never changes.\nFrom the first Military Doctrine in 1993, there has been a notable expansion in both the mentions and importance of different nonmilitary means. The two most notable innovations of the 2014 Military Doctrine were the increasing emphasis on information warfare and on the creation of color revolutions as well as the inclusion of these threats as domestic military dangers. The 2010 Military Doctrine also saw that information warfare was so effective that it could reach strategic objectives by itself, without the need for armed force.

Indeed, he was compared to Gareyev and Gerasimov in terms of prominence in Thomas's study on Russian theorists' views of the nature of war (Thomas 2016b, 3) . Second, he referred to indirect action as a new type of war, discussed in parallel with what he called \"classical\" war, in agreement with Chekinov and Bogdanov. This also resembles what Gerasimov called the adaptive approach to the use of force. Third, he emphasized the key role of information operations, especially online information, while drawing a direct connection between them and color revolutions. In this way, he has continued Gerasimov's argument, seeing nonmilitary means as more important than military, but he is more specific in saying that propaganda and information operations are the most important.\nChekinov and Bogdanov wrote an article in 2015 in which they argued, along with the traditional, Clausewitzian understanding of war, that \"the substance of future wars, indeed their basic attribute-warfare involving the use of arms-has not","chunk_id":"bd400dbd8e753ab71c9394fe8b1f07ce","document_ids":["2b5f6b53a35ec7f386a91b0d2c30bf34"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"KARTAPOLOV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Kartapolov is a key figure in the Russian military, serving as head of the operations directorate on the General Staff.

Therefore, \"the strong promotion of patriotic (in the sense of national or civilizational) ideas by the state and its affiliated NGOs can lead to the eventual creation of a progovernment hive mind that can engage in counter swarms against any enemy insurgents\" (Korybko 2015, 75) .\nIt is noteworthy that Korybko suggested that patriotism and prostate ideas would be an antidote to color revolutions, especially as the public security doctrines had put increasing emphasis on patriotism and the Russian state's role in promoting social cohesion.

Because it believed the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 were organized on social media, the leadership increased restrictions and created its own organization (the Internet Research Agency) to combat grassroots dissent internationally. To be clear, this is not to make a justification for Russian information operations-simply to give the context in which they evolved.\nThe importance of information warfare, and particularly informationpsychological warfare, has become reflected among Russian military theorists and doctrines. For instance, the 2010 Military Doctrine stated that information warfare could achieve political objectives without the use of force. The 2011 Conceptual Views saw it as the armed forces' task to counter information interference in internal affairs. There has also been a notable shift among military theorists to see information-psychological as more important than armed force rather than a complement to it (e.g., Chekinov and Bogdanov; Gerasimov, Kartapolov, and Burenok) . It would not be an exaggeration to state that there has been a militarization of information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare.

Furthermore, is interesting to see how their focus has shifted from earlier, when they were almost exclusively focusing on ideas connected to Slipchenko's sixth-generation warfare.\nIn opposition to the broad understanding of war, the Russian historian Vladimir Makhonin proposed a terminological hierarchy in a study of how war and armed conflict is related. The hierarchy saw social conflict-defined as extreme and intense differences between entities-as the preceding stage to all more intense forms of conflict (Makhonin 2011, 155) . In this hierarchy, military conflict represented a clash on a limited scale, whereas war was a large-scale clash (Makhonin 2011, 152) . In Makhonin's view, war was the highest stage of conflict, followed by social conflict; in the view of Chekinov and Bodganov, for instance, armed conflict was just one of the tools in war, and the state of war preceded its application. This represents a division whereby Makhonin saw war as the most intense form of fighting (and potentially anachronistic) and social conflict as the relevant legitimizing factor, while the other notion of war saw it as a condition that allows a variety of means, including (but not limited to) armed violence.\nIndeed, more theorists started to argue against the concept of war as solely defined","chunk_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e","document_ids":["2dee775e4665bdd8b4fdb6689df4d5e7"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"MILITARY DOCTRINES AND SECURITY STRATEGIES\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"Military Doctrines and Security Strategies is a document that discusses attempts to influence Russia's psychological situation.\"","source_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e"},{"name":"\"RUSSIA\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Russia is the target of psychological operations discussed in Military Doctrines and Security Strategies.\"","source_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e"},{"name":"\"SLIPCHENKO\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Slipchenko is a figure associated with sixth-generation warfare, mentioned in earlier discussions.\"","source_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e"},{"name":"\"VLADIMIR MAKHONIN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Vladimir Makhonin is a Russian historian who proposed a hierarchy of conflict.\"","source_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e"},{"name":"\"CHEKINOV AND BODGANOV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Chekinov and Bodganov are theorists who view war as a condition that allows for various means, including armed violence.\"","source_id":"3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;MILITARY DOCTRINES AND SECURITY STRATEGIES&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Military Doctrines and Security Strategies is a document that discusses attempts to influence Russia's psychological situation.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIA&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Russia is the target of psychological operations discussed in Military Doctrines and Security Strategies.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;SLIPCHENKO&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Slipchenko is a figure associated with sixth-generation warfare, mentioned in earlier discussions.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;VLADIMIR MAKHONIN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Vladimir Makhonin is a Russian historian who proposed a hierarchy of conflict.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;CHEKINOV AND BODGANOV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Chekinov and Bodganov are theorists who view war as a condition that allows for various means, including armed violence.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">3ff11360ddc5bd1fa296a784da747a6e<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

As a result, Russian experts among themselves, and their Western colleagues, often mean different things when using the same terms and use different terms to refer to the same things. Additional factors hamper this lack of codification even further. First, there is a linguistic issue. The Russian professional discourse uses the terms coercion, deterrence and compellence interchangeably. The Russian equivalent of the Western term deterrencesderzhivanierefers to the efforts to preserve the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more reactive modus operandi. The term compellenceprinuzhdenierefers to the efforts to change the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more proactive connotation. There is no established term for coercion, as an umbrella term for both deterrence and compellence. The Russian discourse often utilises the term deterrence but rarely the term compellence to express a concept similar to the Western term coercion. The context usually indicates which of the forms of influence authors are referring to. Second, the terminological discrepancy has perceptual underpinnings.

Western analysts were often led astray when analyzing Soviet military thought because they gave too little attention to the philosophy that Soviet military science relied on (Scott and Scott 1982, 28) .

US target selection remains a driving factor, as does the choice to widen or reduce the actual scope of any potential war.\nSimilarly, knowing and understanding the psychological elements of adversary strategy, such as deterrence by intimidation, can help reduce the coercive effect of such actions during a threatened period of conflict resultant from a political or military crisis. Much of the Russian theory behind single or grouped strikes, and inflicting dosed damage, does not rest so much on the material damage caused as on the psychological effect it will have on adversary's leadership and the population. This is especially relevant in an alliance context, as the damage applied is meant to create cascade effects on a coalition by targeting specific members. Hence, both damage to the target and damage to its role within a coalition are calibrated.\nMuch can also be done in how the US chooses to engage Russian counterparts on this subject. Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems.

Thus, Lenin's view remained, even if the definition expanded to include nonmilitary means of war in some senses. The 1986 military encyclopedia (Voyennyy entsiklopedicheskiy slovar) defined armed struggle as \"the main form of struggle in a war, its specific substance consists in organized employment of armed forces for the attainment of certain political and military ends. It represents a set of military actions of varying scope\" (quoted in Kalistratov 2004, 150-51) .\nIn this definition, armed struggle held a prominent role, and one could assume that if armed struggle was the main method, it was also the defining one.

In the Russian understanding of war, Bartles continued, instead of a \"traditional\" military invasion, the United States would first install a political opposition (supported by media, social media, and nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] ), induce separatism and social strife to weaken the domestic government, and apply special or private force to provoke an overreaction, which creates a pretext for sanctions until the government collapses (Bartles 2016a,","chunk_id":"9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03","document_ids":["32746fea5bb56a5826801d2c058e2184"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"NIKOLAI MAKAROV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Nikolai Makarov is mentioned as the author of a doctrine related to hybrid warfare.\"","source_id":"9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03"},{"name":"\"CHARLES BARTLES\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Charles Bartles is a critic of the terms 'hybrid warfare' and 'the Gerasimov doctrine'.\"","source_id":"9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03"},{"name":"\"GERASIMOV DOCTRINE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"The Gerasimov Doctrine refers to a concept related to hybrid warfare, which involves political, social, and military means.\"","source_id":"9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03"},{"name":"\"HYBRID WARFARE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Hybrid Warfare is a term used to describe a type of conflict that combines traditional military action with non-military tactics.\"","source_id":"9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;NIKOLAI MAKAROV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Nikolai Makarov is mentioned as the author of a doctrine related to hybrid warfare.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;CHARLES BARTLES&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Charles Bartles is a critic of the terms 'hybrid warfare' and 'the Gerasimov doctrine'.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;GERASIMOV DOCTRINE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Gerasimov Doctrine refers to a concept related to hybrid warfare, which involves political, social, and military means.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;HYBRID WARFARE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Hybrid Warfare is a term used to describe a type of conflict that combines traditional military action with non-military tactics.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">9a70b285557b0524306162d74f497e03<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

This represents a division whereby Makhonin saw war as the most intense form of fighting (and potentially anachronistic) and social conflict as the relevant legitimizing factor, while the other notion of war saw it as a condition that allows a variety of means, including (but not limited to) armed violence.\nIndeed, more theorists started to argue against the concept of war as solely defined by armed violence. In consequence, there was growing agreement that the changing understanding of war was making the dichotomy between war and peace anachronistic. This is, for instance, plainly stated by Pavel Antonovich (chair of electronic warfare in the Russian Combined-Arms Academy), who argued that \"dividing lines between war and peace can be eroded conveniently in cyberspace. Damage (whatever its nature) can actually be done to an adversary without overstepping formally the line between war and peace\" (Antonovich 2011, 37) .

In this way, Galeotti saw hybrid war in the sense used by Mattis and Hoffman, which has occurred in Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. That hybrid warfare was also coupled with political war, seen as \"the pure use of political methods to bring about desired changes in the policy in another state\" (Galeotti 2016a, 7) . A large part of the conceptual confusion stems from the fact that both of these were run in parallel (Galeotti 2016a, 7) .\nThe separation into hybrid war and political war is a helpful conceptual solution, but there are also problems with the term \"political war\" (setting aside those with hybrid war). Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for \"the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives\" (Kennan 1948) .

In Lenin's view, Vigor contended, it would have been ridiculous to think of peace as apart from war; rather, if war was the continuation of politics, peace needed to be as well (Vigor 1975, 87) . The Soviet view entailed an understanding that peace, in any other sense than an absence of fighting, was unattainable as long as a capitalist system existed (Scott and Scott 1988, 113) . The class struggle was continuous, even though it did not necessarily require armed conflict when the political circumstances did not favor war (e.g., the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk in 1918) .\nIt is often thought that the Marxist-Leninist affinity for Clausewitz also came from Marx and Engels (see, e.g., Byron 1950 ), but that does not seem to be the case upon closer scrutiny. Azar Gat showed convincingly how Engels found Clausewitz burdensome and preferred Antoine-Henri Jomini, while Marx likely never read him (Gat 1992, 367) . Their correspondence showed that they discussed, and approved of, the idea that war was an art rather than a science, but this exchange did not go much deeper (Gat 1992, 367) .

Nonetheless, he continued that the military threat needed to be viewed holistically with means other than armed force to achieve military-political goals (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Kvachkov then proposed a classification of war that aimed to remedy the failures of theory presented above. It entailed a subdivision of war into \"war with the use of armed warfare\" and \"war with nonmilitary means\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . Of the nonmilitary means, he mentioned information, economic, financial, diplomatic, and cultural, giving particular weight to information means. While discussing the argument that the Cold War was the first information world war, he saw that \"a new type of war has emerged, in which armed warfare has given up its decisive place in the achievement of the military and political objectives of war to another kind of warfare-information warfare\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) .

It is impossible to impose one's strategic will without achieving informational superiority. 16 Operations 'on the theater of informational struggle', aimed at achieving this superiority, blur the lines between war and peace, front and rear, levels and forms of war (offence and defence) and of coercion (deterrence and compellence). 17 Moscow perceives informational struggle as a way of striking back against what it sees as US information warfare (abuses of soft power to interfere in the sovereign internal affairs), the indirect approach and technologies of 'managed chaos' 18the main tools of Western HW. 19 The Russian interpretation of informational struggle comprises both digital-technological and cognitive-psychological components. It is designed to misinform and manipulate the adversary's picture of reality, to interfere with the decision-making process of individuals, organisations, governments and societies and to influence it in order to produce favourable conditions for promoting strategic goals. 20 Sometimes referred to as 'reflexive control', it forces the adversary to act according to a false picture of reality, favourable to the initiator of the informational strike and seemingly benign to the target. 21 Moral-psychological suppression and manipulation of social consciousness aim at damping resistance and harnessing support for the attacker, due to the disillusionment with the government and disorganisation of its management functions. The end result is a desired strategic behaviour of the adversary. 22 The Russian","chunk_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c","document_ids":["34c789ac450d1e20343cdbb048063654"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"MOSCOW\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"Moscow is the organization that perceives informational struggle as a way to counter US information warfare.\"","source_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c"},{"name":"\"US INFORMATION WARFARE\"","type":"","description":"","source_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c"},{"name":"\"RUSSIAN INTERPRETATION OF INFORMATIONAL STRUGGLE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"The Russian interpretation of informational struggle comprises both digital-technological and cognitive-psychological components.\"","source_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c"},{"name":"\"ADVERSARY\"","type":"","description":"","source_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c"},{"name":"\"REFLEXIVE CONTROL\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Reflexive control is a tactic used in informational struggle to force the adversary to act according to a false reality.\"","source_id":"4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;MOSCOW&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Moscow is the organization that perceives informational struggle as a way to counter US information warfare.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;US INFORMATION WARFARE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\" \/>      <data key=\"d1\" \/>      <data key=\"d2\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN INTERPRETATION OF INFORMATIONAL STRUGGLE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Russian interpretation of informational struggle comprises both digital-technological and cognitive-psychological components.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;ADVERSARY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\" \/>      <data key=\"d1\" \/>      <data key=\"d2\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;REFLEXIVE CONTROL&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Reflexive control is a tactic used in informational struggle to force the adversary to act according to a false reality.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/node>    <edge source=\"&quot;MOSCOW&quot;\" target=\"&quot;US INFORMATION WARFARE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Moscow views informational struggle as a response to what it sees as US information warfare.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/edge>    <edge source=\"&quot;RUSSIAN INTERPRETATION OF INFORMATIONAL STRUGGLE&quot;\" target=\"&quot;ADVERSARY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"The Russian interpretation aims to misinform, manipulate, and influence the adversary's reality to achieve strategic goals.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/edge>    <edge source=\"&quot;ADVERSARY&quot;\" target=\"&quot;REFLEXIVE CONTROL&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Reflexive control aims to manipulate the adversary's perception of reality for strategic advantage.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">4029a673e4a82185b802f0ac1cd07c9c<\/data>    <\/edge>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

In this sense, it becomes strange to fit the Russian military-theoretical tradition into a mostly unused concept that often refers to Western conduct when used.\nFridman's characterization of gibridnaya voina as solely being about nonmilitary and nonviolent means becomes too narrow a categorization in which to fit Russian military thought. It goes against Gerasimov's understanding, which can be seen in the article where he first mentioned hybrid methods; he also emphasizes that they relied on the use of military force and also included hidden military measures (Gerasimov 2016a ). Gerasimov has furthermore emphasized the importance of military means in almost every speech he has given. It thus becomes problematic to see gibridnaya voina as fully nonviolent when several Russian theorists discussing the phenomenon see violence as a distinguishing factor for what is considered gibridnaya voina. 4 It does, furthermore, not capture the broader trends in Russian military thought emphasizing both military and nonmilitary means.\nThe use of hybrid warfare has received pointed criticism for being a Western concept applied to Russian warfare without regard for the particular developments and traditions in Russia.

In response to a question from Rasin as to whether Clausewitz was obsolete, Stalin criticized the premise of the question. In Stalin's view, Lenin had used the parts of Clausewitz-the relation of politics and war, how politics engender war, and war as a continuation of politics by violence-already present in Marxist theory (Stalin 1946) . In Stalin's view, Lenin \"not as a military expert, but as a politician . . . used the works of Clausewitz\" to gain support for the view of the role of war and politics (Stalin 1946) . Therefore, Stalin did not go against Lenin's reliance on Clausewitz; rather he accepted it and justified it as if they were already a part of Marxist theory from the start.\nEager to distinguish Soviet military theory from Western, Byely et al.

The differentiating factor between the traditional and nontraditional school was whether they were based on Clausewitz or not. Unfortunately, the authors were not explicit in their understanding of Clausewitz, but it is likely that they meant defining war by armed violence. Depending on how the theorists saw future war, the nontraditionalists were divided into four subcategories: war of consciousness (konstsiyentalnoy voiny), subversion-war (myatezhvoina), remote\/contactless war (distantsionnoy\/bezkontaktniya voiny), and cyberwar (kibervoiny).\nProponents of the notion of war of consciousness saw it as a psychological war in which \"the object of destruction and transformation is the value orientations of the enemy population\" (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 99) .

The amalgamation of these three into a unified programme is the most recent Russian version of coercion across domains.\nSince the mid-2000s, Russian military experts and defence intellectuals, in conjunction with official staff work on nuclear deterrence, started to explore and popularise its conventional,26 'pre-nuclear'27 equivalent.

Nonviolent color revolutions, largely depending on information warfare, are seen as the West's main approach to the use of force. In the view of Russian elites, the threat perception includes the content of information, which makes the understanding of information warfare very broad.

Russian sources, however, do not define their approach as HW and use this term to refer to the Western way of war, which they are trying to counteract. Until recently, HW was not at all part of the Russian official lexicon. Before the 2014 events in Ukraine, the term featured in the professional discourse either in reference to US threat perception or to categorise one of the recent trends in the US's waging of war. 61 Since 2014, it has often been used to refer to the Western standoff with Russia.\nThe intellectual history of the term in the West and the empirical context for its development hardly had any Russian connection.

The 1993 Military Doctrine did not provide an explicit definition of war but contended that \"social, political, territorial, religious, national-ethnic, and other conflicts and the desire of a number of states and political forces to resolve them by means of armed struggle constitute the main reasons for its persistence and for the emergence of armed conflicts and wars\" (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1).\nIt is implied that conflicts would not amount to war without the armed element, which thus was the defining feature.

Rather, as above, the idea that the nature of war is changing, that the boundaries of war and peace are blurring, and that color revolutions are becoming the West's main form of warfare have well-established precedents in the Russian debate. Nonetheless, even if those views existed, they had not entered the mainstream in the way that the chief of the General Staff confirmed them.\nA similar viewpoint was held by military theorist Igor Popov, who saw a radical change in today's wars. He argued that \"the armies have become qualitatively different in all respects, and military actions have become fundamentally different-by the means, forms, and methods used, by the scale and pace of action\" (Popov 2013) . For Popov, \"the form of a military conflict that has arisen in recent years, starting with 'peaceful' antigovernment actions and ending with a brutal civil war and external intervention, may well be called a new type of war\" (Popov 2013) . In Popov's eyes, this new type of war \"goes beyond the traditional idea about war, acquiring a combined character, turning into an intricate tangle of political intrigues, a fierce struggle for resources and financial flows, irreconcilable civilizational clashes\" (Popov 2013) .

Non-nuclear deterrence, a complex 'of foreign policy, military and nonmilitary measures aimed at preventing aggression by nonnuclear means', is the doctrine's main innovation. Within the repertoire of nonnuclear means, the doctrine refers to the use of precision conventional munitions as one of the forceful tools of strategic deterrence. 35 Nonnuclear deterrence does not substitute for but rather complements its nuclear analogue, as part of the 'forceful measures' of strategic deterrencea system of interconnected measures of both forceful (nuclear and nonnuclear) and non-forceful character. This type of deterrence may include force demonstration, to prevent escalation, and even the limited use of force, as a radical measure for de-escalating hostilities. 36 Non-nuclear deterrence attributes a special role to targeting adversary's non-military assets and to activating non-military actors. Threats of financial and economic disruptions should be activated in conjunction with the military component of coercion, such as special operations forces and advanced conventional weapons. 37 Threatening the adversary's assets with massive precision non-n","chunk_id":"cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5","document_ids":["40eb587d22a9eb70ed607bedb11aaba9"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"2014 DOCTRINE\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The 2014 doctrine is a set of military and political guidelines emphasizing non-nuclear deterrence.\"","source_id":"cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5"},{"name":"\"RUSSIAN EXPERT COMMUNITY\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Russian expert community contributed ideas that were codified in the 2014 doctrine.\"","source_id":"cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5"},{"name":"\"NON-NUCLEAR DETERRENCE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Non-nuclear deterrence is a strategy of preventing aggression through non-military means, including economic and informational pressure.\"","source_id":"cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5"},{"name":"\"PRECISION CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS\"","type":"\"TECHNOLOGY\"","description":"\"Precision conventional munitions are a tool used in non-nuclear deterrence to inflict damage on adversary targets.\"","source_id":"cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d5\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d4\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"edge\" attr.name=\"weight\" attr.type=\"double\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;2014 DOCTRINE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The 2014 doctrine is a set of military and political guidelines emphasizing non-nuclear deterrence.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN EXPERT COMMUNITY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Russian expert community contributed ideas that were codified in the 2014 doctrine.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;NON-NUCLEAR DETERRENCE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"CONCEPT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Non-nuclear deterrence is a strategy of preventing aggression through non-military means, including economic and informational pressure.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;PRECISION CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"TECHNOLOGY\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Precision conventional munitions are a tool used in non-nuclear deterrence to inflict damage on adversary targets.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/node>    <edge source=\"&quot;2014 DOCTRINE&quot;\" target=\"&quot;NON-NUCLEAR DETERRENCE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"The 2014 doctrine codifies the concept of Non-nuclear deterrence as its main innovation.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/edge>    <edge source=\"&quot;2014 DOCTRINE&quot;\" target=\"&quot;RUSSIAN EXPERT COMMUNITY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Ideas from the Russian expert community influenced the development of the 2014 doctrine.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/edge>    <edge source=\"&quot;NON-NUCLEAR DETERRENCE&quot;\" target=\"&quot;PRECISION CONVENTIONAL MUNITIONS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d3\">1.0<\/data>      <data key=\"d4\">\"Non-nuclear deterrence utilizes precision conventional munitions as a forceful tool for strategic deterrence.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d5\">cdaf5991490e5afcb16ad8cfae5d9fe5<\/data>    <\/edge>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

It would not be an exaggeration to state that there has been a militarization of information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare. Furthermore, information-psychological warfare is intrinsically linked to color revolutions by its potential to destabilize the state, society, and public consciousness as well as patriotic and spiritual values.\nThe question is thus whether the increasing utility of informationpsychological warfare is causing a change in the Russian understanding of the nature of war. While difficult to state conclusively, this investigation suggests that this is the case. Information-psychological warfare is so effective that it should be considered violent, that it blurs the boundaries of war and peace, and that Russia considers itself to be engaged in a large-scale information war. Furthermore, it is seen as a key enabler for the creation of color revolutions, the major threat from the West in the Russian view. If these statements hold true, they are hardly compatible with the customary definition of war as defined by armed violence. Rather, its definition then would have to expand and thus lead to a change in the nature of war. Information warfare is not just changing the understanding of war in isolation-it is also seen as an integral component in the creation of color revolutions, which have become the main threat for the Russian leadership.

The first is the systematic, or holistic, approach whereby the full sphere of human activity can be targeted. The second is that the doctrine's description of modern war includes extensive use of indirect and nontraditional forms, which increases the emphasis on such forms. Third, this is the first Military Doctrine to list information warfare as a threat (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 57) .\nThe Foreign Policy Concept of 2000 stated that the possibilities for cooperation in the world arena had substantially broadened due to the \"end of confrontation, steady elimination of the consequences of the 'Cold War, ' and the advancements of Russian reforms\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2000b, point II).

Second, characteristics of the Russian coercion paradigm are idiosyncratic, reflect a strong cultural imprint and need be analysed within the context of Russian strategic culture. Although the current Russian concept is in some respects innovative, it reflects the traditional style and remarkable historical continuity, rather than a change in the Russian strategic culture. Finally, some aspects of the new concept may be profoundly destabilising. Although it may be assumed that the Russian innovation, as a form of coercion and not brute force, minimises the scale of kinetic operations and makes it possible to promote national interests without escalating to major war, nonetheless, the Russian approach is saturated with procedural deficits that, unless addressed, may lead to inadvertent escalation.\nA methodological clarification is due. Terminologically, Russian theorising of deterrence is constantly evolving, frequently lacking official codification. Thus, while a significant corpus of ideas on deterrence informs current Russian military theory and policy, the terminological apparatus has been inconsistent. As a result, Russian experts among themselves, and their Western colleagues, often mean different things when using the same terms and use different terms to refer to the same things. Additional factors hamper this lack of codification even further. First, there is a linguistic issue. The Russian professional discourse uses the terms coercion, deterrence and compellence interchangeably.

That is to say, the conduct of information warfare will be considered equal to military conflict. Taken together, Modestov and Tsymbal's arguments suggest that the Russian view both permitted information warfare against others without seeing it as waging war but would at the same time consider the same measures taken against itself as war.\nIt was with this in mind that V. P. Gulin proposed \"a new conception of war. \" He wrote that with the \"informatization of all sides of social life we are witnessing a true revolution in the military sphere\" that would necessitate qualitatively new armed forces (Gulin 1997, 50) . Gulin stated that armed struggle had been believed to be the main feature of war but that social violence could now take many forms: political, economic, ideological, and diplomatic (Gulin 1997, 51) . For this reason, Gulin argued, war should not be understood mainly in terms of armed struggle but rather by the consistent features of the uncompromising struggle (Gulin 1997, 51) .

Thus, the Russian theory of victory is asymmetrical, in that it employs a competitive strategy playing one's strengths against the opponent's weaknesses.\nHowever, the Russian approach, at least in Russian eyes, is also symmetricalthe nature of the threat shapes the nature of the response. Moscow saw the US waging a new type of (hybrid) warfare elsewhere, felt threatened, sought adequate countermeasures and is now erecting a firewall against what it sees as the soft and hard Western power aimed at Russia in an integrated hybrid campaign. Since the current Russian National Security Doctrine views internal and external threats as interconnected, it perceives the threat as a cohesive whole, and the military consequently is expected to address it in a holistic manner. The rising importance of pressing adversaries by non-military means results in a multidimensional merger of soft and hard power, operating non-military activities in conjunction with military (conventional and non-conventional), covert and overt operations, special forces, mercenaries and internal opposition to achieve strategic outcomes.\nThe inaccuracy in qualifying the Russian approach as innovative also relates to the issue of terminology.

How is it possible to ensure that the actors involved in, or observing, the interaction rationalise their moves correctly? How does one communicate red lines and inflict damage without escalating to a major war? Moscow repeatedly expresses genuine frustration that the West attributes to it non-existent strategic intentions in the Baltics, in Ukraine and in Syria. Also, Western responses following the Russian acts of coercion ran against Moscow's expectations and desired end states. The Russian approach presumes signalling, including by intensifying pressure across all domains, to communicate Russian resolve and capability, but the question remains, as Kristin Ven Bruusgaard poses, 'whether the adversary will understand the message of deterrence the way the Russian concept prescribes it'. 69 Experts today lack solid evidence that Russia possesses any framework to estimate that its signalling has been grasped correctly. Comprehensible signalling and verification that signals have been absorbed and perceived as intended is a vital, but possibly sometimes missing, part of the Russian approach.\nThis issue is linked to the evaluation challenge. How does one establish the effectiveness of one's deterrence programme on an opponent's decision-making?

Regarding Russia being under attack, he saw that the goals of the enemy were obvious: \"a complete demoralisation of the Russian population and then the demoralisation of Russian authorities and administration\" (Pravda 2014). Thus, it seems that the conclusion of the wide definition of information-psychological warfare is that there is an ongoing attack against Russia. Expressing a similar notion, Anatoly Maruyev, a military theorist, argued that \"since Russia's geopolitical opponents, in particular, the U.S. and its allies, have intensified geopolitical rivalry and the information war they have started against Russia, it is important for this country to respond to the information war adequately to maintain its own information security\" (Maruyev 2009, 8) .\nA similar view was given by Nikolai Borduzha, secretary-general of the Collective Security Treaty Organization and a former secretary of the Russian Security Council and chief of presidential staff.

Several years prior to the 2014 doctrine, the GS's research on an indirect approach in warfare recommended increasing 'asymmetrical measures'. 39 GS officers argued that the sophistication of weaponry and the catastrophic consequences incline actors to non-military means. Whereas in the past, the 'brute force' dominated military affairs and the 'indirect approach' had a secondary role, the situation now is reversed. The employment of asymmetrical means enables to damage a 'stronger' adversary, and even impose political will, without a decisive battlefield victory. Success results from the skilful orchestration of military and non-military (political, psychological, ideological and informational) efforts. According to the authors, today, the ability to master an 'indirect approach' manifests the excellence of military art; its culmination is the employment of a variety of means, primarily informational dominance, to neutralise the enemy without the use of force, to prevent military confrontation altogether or to mitigate its consequences.

Preciously little attention is paid to the question of escalation management, which should take priority in contests between major nuclear powers. Thinking on war termination is similarly nascent. This gap is in part born of a sustained great power interregnum since World War II, but also stems from the lack of attention given this subject in the post-Cold War period.\nThe political leadership of any state entering a crisis with a nuclear peer will inevitably wish to be assuaged that a reasonably plausible strategy exists for escalation management and war termination. Otherwise, when faced with the potential for uncontrolled nuclear escalation, they might be self-deterred, or as the Russian leadership might suspect, vulnerable to manipulation of risk. This is especially so in cases where the US does not have vital interests at stake or is unclear about the interests at stake. Although we cannot predict what choices Russia's political leadership might make, it is less likely to be self-deterred if its military establishment has developed several plausible options for escalation management and war termination from crisis to large-scale war. These employ flexible means, many of which are usable because they are either conventional or non-forceful in nature, while others represent an iterative approach to nuclear escalation which inherently eschews the notion that it may be uncontrolled.\nHence, the Russian political leadership may consider a conflict, even against a superior adversary, as a risky but ultimately manageable affair.

It agrees with the tendency among some late Soviet theorists, discussed in the previous chapter, to shift away from defining war solely as an armed struggle. He argued that armed struggle is \"a part of war-war being a complex social and political phenomenon embracing all spheres of life in the nations engaged, with diverse ways of fighting the enemy including industrial, political and psychological means, with armed struggle being paramount among them\" (Gareyev 1998, viii) .\nGareyev thus landed somewhere between the revolutionary and the conservative alternatives, in that he recognized that armed struggle is both one component of many while also continuing to describe it as the most important component. He further argued that the essence of war cannot be changed, even by the invention of nuclear weapons (Gareyev 1998, 19) . This is a response to arguments that nuclear war cannot be considered an instrument of policy since it would lead to mutually assured destruction and hence fail to achieve political objectives. Gareyev acknowledged that it is in general very hard to achieve political goals with nuclear weapons but that this was rather a question of expediency than a change in the nature of war. To support this, he referred to the only time when nuclear weapons have been used, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki; both cases made it clear that they served US policy (Gareyev 1998, 20) .

Many of the key concepts-deep operations, echeloned formation in the attack, the primacy of the offensive, and the importance of engagement-persisted in various forms (Scott and Scott 1982, 18) . This chapter analyzes the development of the Soviet understanding of war from Lenin's early writings until the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991.\nWhile not entering into a comparative study, it discusses the particularities of this \"broader and deeper\" Soviet understanding. It begins by discussing the particular features of Soviet military science. Thereafter, it analyzes the nature of war in the Soviet understanding in terms of the definition, the root cause of war, and the view of war as an instrument of politics.\nBefore venturing into the Soviet understanding of war, a few words are merited on Soviet military science. The starting point for investigating the nature of war was the established views and ideology of the Communist Party. It was from the precepts therein that Soviet military science drew when forming its system of knowledge. This included the character of war, the laws of war, the preparation of the armed forces for war, and the methods of waging war (Scott and Scott 1982, 5) .

Hoffman defined an enemy who uses hybrid threats as \"any adversary that simultaneously employs a tailored mix of conventional weapons, irregular tactics, terrorism, and criminal behavior in the same time and battlespace to obtain their political objectives\" (Hoffman 2014 ; see also Hoffman 2007 Hoffman , 2009 Hoffman , 2010)) . This definition explicitly refers to synchronicity in time and space on the operational level, which makes the definition narrow. Hoffman also pointed out that the definition excludes nonmilitary means, such as economic, information, and subversive political acts, except when they are associated with terrorist and irregular tactics (Hoffman 2014 ). 3 This way of defining hybrid warfare is therefore narrow enough to be analytically useful for the military's operational analysis, but it does not capture the key elements of what made Russian warfare successful in Ukraine, nor was it meant to.\nTo dispel the definitional confusion, Mark Galeotti usefully argued that the debate deals with two parallel, yet overlapping, phenomena: \"One is true 'hybrid war, ' the other perhaps best considered 'political war'\" (Galeotti 2016a, 7 ; see also Galeotti 2016b Galeotti , 2019)) .

This echoed Slipchenko, who had also argued that information had become a weapon.\nIn the 2010s, General Bogdanov formed a prolific duo with Colonel Chekinov. In a 2010 study, \"Asymmetrical Actions to Maintain Russia's Military Security, \" Chekinov and Bogdanov argued that while the threat of military force was persistent, military security could now not be decoupled from all other forms of security, such as political, economic, and information (Chekinov and Bogdanov 2010, 3) . They put particular focus on information operations, which they saw as capable of achieving strategic goals by themselves (Chekinov and Bogdanov 2010, 8) .

The Military Encyclopedic Dictionary defined myatezhvoina as armed fighting by insurgent or rebel forces (Ministry of Defense 2007). The dictionary emphasized that there were no pronounced lines of confrontation but rather that action included disruption of political and military control, aggravation of the humanitarian situation, and financial support from abroad (Ministry of Defense 2007). This, however, creates some confusion with the thought of Messner, who explicitly differentiated myatezhvoina from insurgencies (see chapter 3).

This represented a continuation of the thought of Marx and Engels and became one of the core points of the Soviet understanding of war. Wars were, Lenin argued, \"inseparable from the political systems that engender them\" (Lenin 1917, 25) . Wars would inevitably occur by virtue of the existence of exploitative political systems, until the whole world has become communist. In the \"Military Programme of the Proletarian Revolution, \" Lenin wrote, \"Only after the proletariat has disarmed the bourgeoisie will it be able, without betraying its world-historic mission, to consign all armaments to the scrap-heap\" (Lenin 1916b, 2, italics in the original) . This view of perpetual conflict was confirmed by Frunze, one of the most acclaimed Soviet military theorists and commissar for the army and navy in 1925, who saw that \"between our proletarian state

The holistic approach (kompleksnyi\/sistemnyi podhod) is an all-embracing view that grasps a big picture and describes every element of reality as being in constant interplay with others in frames of a metasystem, views issues in different dimensions as interconnected, has a generalised frame of reference and perceives every move of any element of the system as a complexity of measures. This Russian intellectual disposition resonates with general systems theory, but it was evident long before Norbert Wiener and Ludwig von Bertalanffy published their works.\nScholars of Russia from

Gareyev saw that the reasons for these military threats was that nuclear weapons had become an impediment for large-scale war and that, \"therefore, the leadership of the modern world seeks to achieve political goals through 'color revolutions' in the opposing countries, large-scale information-campaigns, and unleashing local clashes\" (Gareyev 2017 ). Thus, Gareyev's article emphasized the split in the Russian debate on the thinking of the nature of war. Moreover, he was not conclusively promoting the idea that the traditional definition should be the superior one but, rather, settled on the need to clarify what the nature of war was today. Moreover, due to the increasing effectiveness in the use of nonmilitary means, he also advocated for a change in the laws of war.\nGerasimov also reflected on the debate in Russia on the changing nature of war.

In this way, he has continued Gerasimov's argument, seeing nonmilitary means as more important than military, but he is more specific in saying that propaganda and information operations are the most important.\nChekinov and Bogdanov wrote an article in 2015 in which they argued, along with the traditional, Clausewitzian understanding of war, that \"the substance of future wars, indeed their basic attribute-warfare involving the use of arms-has not changed from the past. The growing role of other types of warfare (economic, ideological, psychological, informational, and so on) will not alter the essence of future wars\" (Chekinov and Bogdanov 2015, 93) .\nSimultaneously, they emphasized information warfare, which they saw as \"the starting point of every action now called the new type of warfare\" (Chekinov and Bogdanov 2015, 93) .

Albeit less explicitly, the shifting understanding of war was also reflected in the main security doctrines, which emphasized the role of information warfare in both war and peacetime that could reach strategic goals by itself, as well as ideological confrontations related to color revolutions.\nThe views that nonmilitary and nonviolent means are so effective that they should be considered violent, blurring the boundary between war and peace, and an ongoing form of warfare are hardly compatible with the traditional understanding of war as defined by armed violence. Rather, the understanding of nature of war among current Russian theorists and elites has broadened and cannot anymore be seen as solely defined by armed force. This understanding has gone from being voiced by a few theorists to the mainstream of Russian thought, as reflected by security doctrines and key officials.\nWhile central theorists and elites have implied a change in the nature of war, there has not been an unequivocal authoritative statement that war is no longer defined solely by armed violence or the threat thereof. However, this should not be expected, and such a declaration would have significant consequences. First, the concept of armed attack and armed violence is the basis of international law as well as the Russian federal law On Defense, which regulates the use of the armed forces.

This chapter demonstrates how the increasing importance of nonmilitary means and their potential to affect the nature of war has been a long-standing discussion in Russia.\nChapter 3 investigates the Russian understanding of information warfare, both in terms of key events and the views of elites and theorists.

Applying a Western conceptual framework to explain a foreign operational art, divorcing it from its foreign ideational context and from what the foreigners say to themselves may lead to misperceptions. Utilising the term HW, which dominates the professional discourse in analysing the Russian concept of 'NGW', seems to be a misrepresentation.

He found that \"a recent search on open-source data indicated that NGW has almost completely disappeared from Russian military literature. There were zero hits on the topic over the past 1500 days\" (Thomas 2017, 143) . Therefore, it seems that the concept of NGW gathered momentum for being an accessible and interesting concept that described the Russian modus operandi in Ukraine rather than for its role of influencing Russian military thought.\nAs the concept of hybrid warfare started to fall out of favor, the Gerasimov doctrine gained popularity. This refers to the thoughts Valery Gerasimov expressed in a 2013 speech, but the term was first used by Galeotti-something he came to regret. In an undated update to his article, he added \"I was just going for a snappy title. I really didn't expect (or want) it to become a more generally used term\" (Galeotti 2014 ; see also Galeotti 2018b) . He continued to argue that if it was anyone's doctrine, it was Nikolai Makarov's but that the article should rather be seen as an observation about war in the twenty-first century rather than a Russian doctrine (Galeotti 2014) .

For example, Russian analysts discuss prospective strategic operations that merge other operations conceptually, like a strategic deterrence forces operation and a strategic operation of general purpose forces. From their standpoint a further reduction is desirable, while perhaps adding others such as a strategic space operation.175 Some analysts also argue for the importance of the information dimension, even positing the possibility of a strategic operation at the theater of information combat. 176 Writings in Russian military articles suggest a shift toward the operational integration of conventional and nuclear forces. Before the advent of strategic conventional systems, integration involved the potential use of NSNW and SNF in strategic operations, with NSNW focused particularly on an opponent's missile defense infrastructure. Since 2011, there has been a trend toward discussing integrated employment of conventional and nuclear precision strike systems in an operational context.

(Svechin 1927, 83) From this understanding of war, it becomes clear that Svechin held violence as the key defining factor of what differentiated the ever-ongoing political conflict with war or civil war. Nonetheless, Svechin, notorious in the Soviet Union for arguing for defensive strategy based on attrition, also focused on the economic front. He saw that \"war is waged not only on an armed front; it is also waged on the class and economic fronts\" (Svechin 1927, 84) . Under Stalin, however, Svechin was purged and thereafter a \"nonperson\" in Soviet military theory whose books and articles were placed in a closed collection with restricted access (Kipp 1992, 56) . His work was later revived and became especially prominent again in the 1980s.\nIn correspondence with a Colonel Professor Rasin, Stalin elaborated his view of Lenin's incorporation of Clausewitz.

This included a priority for Russia to develop command, control, and communications (C 3 ) systems and precision weapons (Fitzgerald 1994, 17) . American analyst Mary Fitzgerald (1994) concluded that there was a strong civilian-military consensus on these requirements. The major innovations came from what was called \"nontraditional\" weapons, ranging from laser, superhigh-frequency, and infrasonic weapons to electronic and information warfare relating to C 3 (Fitzgerald 1994, 171-73) . Additional focus areas included stealth technology and advanced naval weaponry (Renz 2016b, 26) .

This section examines both.\nSince the Soviet collapse, two strategies of nuclear deterrence gradually emerged in Russia. The first, based on the threat of massive launch-on-warning and retaliation strikes, aimed at deterring nuclear aggression. The second, based on the threat of limited nuclear strikes, aimed at deterring conventional aggression and terminating a large-scale regional war. In most of the Russian references of that period, global deterrence rested on a strategic nuclear arsenal, and regional deterrence on nonstrategic nuclear weapons, although Russian thinking on this matter has never been coherent. The causal mechanism underlying this approach, defined in the West as 'regional nuclear deterrence' or 'deterrence and de-escalation doctrine', has not been officially elaborated. According to Adamsky, 'implicitly, it assumed that regional conventional wars would not involve values for which the adversary would tolerate the risk of even a single nuclear strike. Consequently, limited nuclear use would deter or terminate conventional hostilities, without escalation to a massive nuclear exchange'. 7 Scholars concur that scenario vignettes from the military exercises of that period demonstrated that when a counterattack by nonstrategic nuclear weapons restored the status quo; the adversary did not retaliate and terminated hostilities. 8 This period lasted until about 2009-10 and is relatively familiar to Western scholars.

These trends would shape armed struggle to the extent that there is a possibility for a new kind of military confrontation of \"unconventional wars (non-military forms of armed struggle) in which armed forces would conduct no operations or will play only a secondary role\" (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) . This possibility, coupled with the destructiveness of nuclear weapons, would make large-scale wars less likely and unconventional wars a real possibility (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 26) . Furthermore, the dialectical development showed that the information component in a confrontation was increasing in importance (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 22) . Thus, they contended that it was not the form of violence that differentiated war from other activities but rather the intensity, length, and victory or defeat (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) .

The concept noted-rightly, in retrospect, since it was published just before the financial crisis hit Russia-that the critical state of the economy was the main threat to Russia's national security (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III).\nSimultaneously, the concept held that international competition was intensifying for securing access to resources and markets (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point I). Moreover, it noted that a number of states were actively trying to destabilize Russia through their intelligence agencies, aiming to destroy the Russian Federation's territorial integrity by using \"interethnic, religious, and other internal contradictions\" to ultimately reduce Russia's importance (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III).

Kalistratov argued for an understanding of armed conflict by drawing upon the term \"struggle\" (borba), which he defined as \"efforts to overcome your adversary, [a] contest between two forces\" and then simply added \"armed\" (vooruzhennaya) to describe when an entity is equipped with manufactured means for the struggle (Kalistratov 2004, 151-52) .

Although a majority of Western experts have devoted attention to Russian nuclear strategy, only a few scholars explored this new cross-domain coercion vision that is driving Moscow's behavior. 1 These important contributions notwithstanding, the new Russian paradigm remains relatively under-explored due to its constant evolution and demands continuous critical analysis. The dearth of knowledge about its cultural underpinnings also looms large.\nOnly one work has offered cultural explanations of Russian strategic thought, 2 and no research explores the impact of strategic culture on the conceptualisation of deterrence. Finally, while cross-domain coercion emerges as a separate theoretical field, distinct from its nuclear and conventional analogues, a growing body of research that is trying to fill this void 3 so far has overlooked the Russian case. No work has overviewed the intellectual history of the post-Soviet conceptualisation of deterrence and offered a cultural explanation of its current cross-domain state.\nThis article aims to address these shortcomings. Empirically, it traces the intellectual history of Russian deterrence theory up to its current stage and critically discusses its essence. On the theoretical side, by analysing a case outside of Western strategic thought, which traditionally has dominated deterrence theory, the article demonstrates how strategic concepts evolve differently in various ideational contexts.

The points that received stronger emphasis-other factors becoming as important as military means and the overthrowing of legitimate regimes while using the protest potential of the population-also resonated with the shift in the military-theoretical discussion.\nThe deputy secretary of the Security Council of the Russian Federation (the body in charge of drafting the doctrine), Mikhail Popov, saw that events after 2010 required further clarification of certain provisions in a new doctrine.

Bartles thus argues, although not explicitly, that these nonmilitary means are changing the Russian military's understanding of war away from something strictly defined by armed violence. For all its merits, Bartles's study is only eight pages long and does not delve into the questions of how theorists other than Gerasimov discussed the issue, how and when the understanding of nonmilitary means has changed, and why these means came to be seen as useful.\nBartles argued in a subsequent article that the 2014 Military Doctrine and Gerasimov's 2013 article showed an acceptance of the view that color revolutions and Arab Spring-type events were the largest threats to the Russian government, as opposed to military invasions (Bartles 2016b, 9) . These were understood among Russian military theorists as the mastery of new forms and methods of warfare by the West (Bartles 2016b, 4) .

This is indeed a new development in Russian military thinking\" (Bartles 2016b, 4) .

The problem, Kalistratov contended, was that this missed the other essential activities in war. He continued to argue that in the previous ten years, there had been a gradual shift away from the traditional domain of armed violence to others. This shift meant that armed struggle will \"embrace the geophysical, ecological, ethnic, psychological and emotional domains\" (Kalistratov 2004, 153) . Given his expansive definition of armed struggle, it could then be seen to be ongoing in all those nontraditional domains.\nLt. Gen.

Furthermore, many of the characteristics that set Russian military thought apart from its Western equivalent, such as the reliance on holism and dialectical materialism, were also introduced during the Soviet period. Soviet military theorists and political elites had a different way of approaching military thought, and arguably it was deeper and broader than Western approaches, as the quote above emphasizes.\nThe body of military theory and authoritative views was exceptionally stable throughout the history of the Soviet Union. This was partly because the essence of war was indeed seen as static and partly because all military theory and military science had to reflect the established views and ideology of the Communist Party, from which military doctrine and military strategy was derived-that is, all authoritative ideas on matters of war and military policy derived from party policy (Scott and Scott 1982, 13) . Military doctrine was divided into a political part and a military part. The political part was the superordinate, and it changed little (Light 1988, 13) . The military part was also quite stable, with much of the foundation of Soviet military theory developed in the 1920s and 1930s.

This is further complicated by varying degrees of precision in the use of terms; some terms are very clearly defined and used with precision, while others are not.\nFor instance, a key distinction for this book is between the nature and character of war. In the Russian language, however, the nature of war is often translated kharakter voiny, which literally translates to the character of war, which it can also mean. There is no simple way around this except to look closely at the context and use the original Russian phrase when the meaning is unclear. Moreover, the nature of war can also be described as sushchnost (essence) and priroda (nature). Another potential source of confusion is the use of terms such as nevoyennoye (nonmilitary), nenasilstvennyye (nonviolent), and netraditsionnyye (nontraditional\/unconventional).

The understanding of armed force as the defining factor of war rather than nonmilitary means can also be found in the thought of Khrushchev, who argued in a speech on October 10, 1959, that \"coexistence is the continuation of the struggle between the two social systems, but a struggle by peaceful means, without war. . . . We consider it to be an economic, political and ideological struggle, but not a military one\" (quoted in Sokolovsky 1963, 275, italics in original) .\nNonetheless, war as solely defined by armed force started to meet resistance from certain military scholars and philosophers in the early 1960s. Military theorists Svyatoslav Kozlov, Mikhail Smirnov, Ivan Baz, and Pyotr Sidorov argued that war was broader; in war, political, economic, ideological, and psychological means were used to influence the enemy and thus needed to be included in the definition of war. In their view, the strict definition of war as violence missed other effective ways of influencing the enemy.

Rather, Kazarin held that economic and information warfare needed to be included in the analysis to reveal war's proper content (Kazarin 2002, 19) . This was because the economy is the foundation of a country's might, and its weakening could be done by all kinds of means, especially nonviolent ones (Kazarin 2002, 19) . When it came to information warfare, Kazarin argued that it had been used by the United States \"to exert an all-round pressure on [unfriendly countries'] political and cultural life to undermine society's national and state foundation and penetrate all level of state administration\" (Kazarin 2002, 19) . Thus, Kazarin contended that information warfare in the US view was a phenomenon outside the realm of war and peace since it was going on continuously (Kazarin 2002, 19) .

For this and the following reasons, this article does not use the term 'strategic deterrence' and instead introduces the term 'cross-domain coercion' to refer to the phenomenon under scrutiny. First, this will prevent confusion with Russian references to the use of the nuclear arsenal to deter a nuclear threat, which is also referred to as 'strategic deterrence'. Second, it will better express the logic of the Russian concept. The term 'deterrence', as it features in the Russian discourse, implies also compellence, general prevention of the threat from materialising, deterrence in peacetime and the use of force during wartime to shape the battlefield. In all these cases, this is not a brute force strategy but a coercion aimed at manipulating the adversary's perception and at influencing its strategic behaviour.\nThis article sticks to the Russian terminology as much as possible. However, to enable a common terminological ground, and bridge the gap between the incoherence of the Russian discourse and the Western lexicon, it introduces the term cross-domain coercion as a heuristic expression representing the cloud of ideas circulating in the Russian community on the subject matter.

The definite border between peaceful and military international relations has been abolished\" (Messner 1959, 70) . For Messner, subversion-war did not need to include physical actions; rather, as pointed out by Fridman, \"The true art of subversion-war, according to Messner, involves indirect and seemingly unrelated actions that encourage internal confrontations\" (Fridman 2018, 69 ).\nMessner's general ideas of subverting a state and eroding its morale and values through psychological means became central in Russian military thinking in the 2010s (see chapter 4).

Last, Gareyev argued that \"under the new conditions, military force as the primary means of achieving goals will increasingly give way to political and other nonmilitary means\" (Gareyev 2012) .\nIn this sense, Gareyev's article again displayed a duality. On the one hand, he saw that nonmilitary means were replacing military force as the primary means of achieving political goals and also a primary threat to the Russian Federation. In this two-step approach, he argued for what Gerasimov later titled the \"adaptive approach\" to the use of force. Furthermore, he saw that these nonmilitary means can be violent in nature as well as blur the boundaries of confrontation. These two notions are, together with the heightened emphasis on color revolutions, novelties in his thought.

This theory rested on two ideas: the nonviolent or \"soft\" overthrow via color revolutions and the violent overthrow of unconventional warfare. Korybko also saw an inverse relationship between the traditional application of direct warfare and indirect means. He stated that \"the closer that US destabilization operations get towards their targeted cores (Russia, Iran, China), the lower the probability of direct warfare and higher the chances that indirect means . . . will be applied\" (Korybko 2015, 71) .

While digital sabotage aims at disrupting a state's managerial capacity, psychological subversion aims at deceiving the victim, discrediting the leadership, and disorienting and demoralising the population and the military. Second, it is unified, in that it synchronises informational struggle with kinetic and non-kinetic military activities and with effects from other sources of power.

The latter can be done by nonmilitary forms, and it is worth quoting at length how the authors understood them. Gorbunov and Bogdanov saw that the internal weakening of a state included \"the taking of informational, psychological, moral, climatic, and organizational measures, setting up and encouraging destructive opposition, and secretly fomenting and intensifying ethnic strife and ethnic conflicts\" (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) . It is noteworthy that they are confirming the view that the state is being undermined by the use of informationpsychological means. They further saw that a state's position in international relations could be weakened by encumbering it with financial debts that drain it of all resources and, thereby, slow down its economic development; surrounding the target country with the would-be aggressor's satellite countries to manipulate its international ties; and building bridgeheads for launching an attack and keeping off any foreign aid in case of aggression. This scenario was played out shortly before the aggression against Yugoslavia, accompanied by military and economic espionage, reconnaissance, and sabotage.

Putin stated in a speech in 2012 that Russia's experience shows that \"cultural identity, spiritual and moral values, and value codes are the realm of tough competition and sometimes targets of open information warfare [protivoborstvo] and well-orchestrated propaganda attacks. Attempts to influence the outlook of entire peoples, the desire to subordinate their will, to impose one's system of values and concepts-are an absolute reality\" (Putin 2012b) .\nThis statement particularly pointed out the influence on values and culture that information warfare gives and the connection to color revolutions. Putin also saw that this phenomenon was an ongoing reality. This information confrontation is seen to have the potential to lead to the loss of a national idea and of spiritual and material values, as well as to a political or economic crisis or the disintegration of the army (Zaitseva 2014, 58) . The Russian perception was argued to be that information warfare could ultimately unhinge society and the state (Blank 2008b, 491) .\nThe then chief of the Main Operational Directorate of the General Staff, Lt.

He furthermore saw that information resources had become one of the most effective weapons. Similarly, Chekinov and Bogdanov saw that unconventional warfare and warfare of controlled chaos were defining international relations today, in which nonmilitary means, notably information and psychological warfare, were key to victory. This made military means secondary, and they saw that nonmilitary means could remove military threats. Moreover, Kartapolov saw that indirect actions were a new type of war in parallel with classical war. Many theorists, most notably Gareyev, also saw that the nonmilitary means were so effective that they should be considered violent in nature. Therefore, Gareyev called for a reconsideration of the whole system of knowledge surrounded war, traditionally defined by armed violence.\nEven though several theorists have argued for views that would entail a change in the nature of war, only a few have explicitly stated that the nature of war should not be understood as armed violence alone anymore. Rather, a common way to handle the paradox of defining war by armed violence and the increasing utility of nonmilitary means has been to introduce new concepts.

In all likelihood, it is to be expected that the potentialities of these weapons will be rising during the 21st century and in the longer run (2020s-2030s) they can become no less effective than nuclear weapons. (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 22) This argument was echoed almost verbatim by Chief of the General Staff Nikolai Makarov in 2010 and by President Putin in 2012. The later chief of the General Staff Valery Gerasimov also repeated the notion that armed forces would conduct no operations or only play a secondary role in future war. The arguments by Gorbunov and Bogdanov are thus interesting for two reasons. First, they were far-reaching in contending that the forms of competition were not the relevant factor. They viewed that in this confrontation, conventional military operations would hold little or secondary importance for the outcome. In this way, they proposed the concept of unconventional warfare that would be conducted by nonmilitary means. Second, they had a notable impact among key figures of Russian military theory, especially Bogdanov, who played a key role in the debate in the 2010s.\nThree years after the last National Security Concept, a new one was adopted in 2000.

In part, it may be because the West engages Moscow with only a vague understanding of the conceptual foundations and perception of Russian strategists. A recommendation for policymakers would be to initiate academic exchanges and second-track activities with Russian defence intellectuals to co-explore theoretical constructs of deterrence and to co-share indigenous perceptions on the subject. These conceptual-theoretical engagements on the nature of deterrence and cross-domain coercion may better educate Russian and Western policymakers about each other and reduce the likelihood of miscommunication and inadvertent escalation.\nOn a more theoretical note, the findings of this study urge the introduction of an idiosyncratic approach to exploring deterrence. The concept of tailoring deterrence strategy to the nature of the specific actor is already common wisdom. This study has shown that the understanding of deterrence strategies of different actors should be tailored as well. Emerging in a specific cultural context, deterrence conceptualisation is not universal and varies across strategic communities. This conclusion is in accord with earlier theoretical findings suggesting that 'theories of victory', operational art and coercion are social constructions, and their conceptualisation, consequently, has national characteristics and may differ from Western strategic theory. Although scholars should examine and measure an actor's modus operandi in a more idiosyncratic manner, they also naturally seek a sound parsimonious theory to deal with certain paradigmatic situations.

The advent of a new generation was mostly seen to be driven by technology, but technological innovation alone does not suffice as a description. Rather, a revolution meant a radical change in capabilities, doctrines, and organization, so fighting took on a fundamentally different form. The most authoritative work on the subject is by Vladimir Slipchenko, whose taxonomy of warfare is still the basis for most modern Russian theorists. The first generation was 500 BC-900 AD, with hand-to-hand fighting and primitive arms. The second generation, 900-1700, featured firearms. Third-generation wars, from 1700 to 1800, were fought with increased firepower, trench warfare, and battles on the oceans. The fourth generation, from 1800 to 1945, included the advent of automatic weapons, tanks, and air battles. The fifth generation introduced nuclear weapons, which were seen by some to render political goals unachievable. The sixth generation started in 1990 and was characterized by precision weapons and information and electronic warfare; the goal was to destroy the enemy's economy with noncontact (i.e., long-distance) warfare. Slipchenko saw that warfare was just about to enter its sixth generation in the 1990s (Slipchenko 2005, 15) .\nThe Soviet understanding of war came directly from Lenin.

Fridman argued that there are three distinct meanings of hybrid warfare. The first is the original from Mattis and Hoffman, focusing on military problems; the second is how \"Russian hybrid warfare\" was conceptualized in the West as a mix of military and nonmilitary means; and the third distinct meaning, similar to Kennan, was how gibridnaya voina, the literal translation of \"hybrid war\" into Russian, was emerging in the Russian discourse as \"solely based on non-military means\" (Fridman 2018, 44, 155) .

Previously there had not existed any means that could make the impact of the enemy's mind effective (Burenok 2014) .

The Military Doctrine stated that military conflicts are defined by their objectives and the forms and methods of struggle (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.11 ). This appears similar to the view of Gareyev, who reasoned that it is the method that distinguishes the perpetration of war from warfare (perhaps unsurprising, as Gareyev was one of the authors of the doctrine).\nThe first characteristic of contemporary military conflicts was the integrated use of military and nonmilitary means (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.12a). Another was the increasing role of information warfare. Information warfare was seen to be implemented before military force to either achieve political objectives by itself or to shape a favorable response from the world community to allow a nation to utilize force (Ministry of Defense 2010, point II.13b). In this way, the application of information warfare transcended the boundaries of war and peace and is able to achieve political goals by itself.

In the doctrine, the concept of war was also followed by \"armed conflict\" in parenthesis for clarification (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.2). Therefore, the 1993 doctrine sees war and armed conflict as synonymous.\nNonetheless, the doctrine departed from the Soviet view in three notable aspects. The first was the change from the view that wars were inevitable. The doctrine asserted that confrontation generated by ideological antagonism could be overcome via cooperation (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1) in the context of improving East-West relations at the time. The doctrine even went as far as to state that the Russian Federation regarded no state as its enemy (Ministry of Defense 1993, point 2.1). Second, the policy declared by Brezhnev of no first use of nuclear weapons against nuclear states and nonuse against nonnuclear states was dropped (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 81) . Rather, the doctrine did not mention any principles of no first use and that the nonuse of nuclear weapons against nonnuclear states was valid only if they were a part of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and were not cooperating with a nuclear state (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 81) .

He then criticized Clausewitz for defining war only as a continuation of foreign policy and so narrowly that it excluded the nonmilitary forms of struggle, such as diplomatic, economic, social, and others (Kirshin 2013) . Nonetheless, he held it as unacceptable that information warfare was mixed with the concept of war. War was necessarily armed struggle, and the lack thereof was peace (Kirshin 2013) .

According to Russian military writings, efforts to inflict objective damage on an adversary can involve an understanding of vitally important objects on adversary territories, analysis of possible approaches to damaging them, development of criteria for \"unacceptable\" damage inflicted, and determination of the nomenclature and characteristics of means that are capable of inflicting \"unacceptable damage.\" Efforts to inflict subjective damage can involve, first and foremost, an understanding of the state's political system that makes the decisions. 196 Subjective damage concepts incorporate reflexive control mechanisms and intend to affect populations and leadership decision-making. 197 For example, one military analyst has argued that non-quantifiable targets such as those specific to decision-makers (summer homes, assets) or targets that pertain to a high quality of life and spiritual development (cultural centers, monuments) could be most significant. 198 Another one advised in 2011 that Russia needed to focus on a countervalue strategy based on subjective criteria of unacceptability, thus employing reflexive control. 199","chunk_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c","document_ids":["76db6ad03e91926ade58fbbd18be1ce4"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"MILITARY ANALYST\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"A Military Analyst provides insights and advice on strategic targets, including subjective damage concepts.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"},{"name":"\"DECISION-MAKERS\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Decision-makers are individuals who hold positions of authority and influence in a state's political system.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"},{"name":"\"SUMMER HOMES\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Summer Homes are personal residences used for leisure, potentially considered targets for subjective damage.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"},{"name":"\"ASSETS\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Assets can refer to valuable possessions or resources, potentially targeted for subjective damage.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"},{"name":"\"CULTURAL CENTERS\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Cultural Centers are institutions dedicated to art, history, and cultural preservation, potentially considered targets for subjective damage.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"},{"name":"\"MONUMENTS\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Monuments are structures or sites of historical significance, potentially targeted for subjective damage.\"","source_id":"ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;MILITARY ANALYST&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"A Military Analyst provides insights and advice on strategic targets, including subjective damage concepts.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;DECISION-MAKERS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Decision-makers are individuals who hold positions of authority and influence in a state's political system.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;SUMMER HOMES&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Summer Homes are personal residences used for leisure, potentially considered targets for subjective damage.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;ASSETS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Assets can refer to valuable possessions or resources, potentially targeted for subjective damage.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;CULTURAL CENTERS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Cultural Centers are institutions dedicated to art, history, and cultural preservation, potentially considered targets for subjective damage.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;MONUMENTS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Monuments are structures or sites of historical significance, potentially targeted for subjective damage.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">ff26a07c83518bf86bdee8bad2f2f78c<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

This is not an uncommon way to see war, but it could differ somewhat from the Western understanding. In the Soviet view, the underlying policy of a government remained, while it used peace or war as instruments to further its policy depending on circumstance (Vigor 1975, 8) . In other words, \"Peace is assessed in precisely the same way as war\" (Lider 1977, 223) . In the West, Peter Vigor argued, perhaps provocatively, that war was conversely understood as a \"terrible disaster which bursts upon men as a kind of act of god, erupting for no reason and conducted for purposes which are never implemented when the fighting has stopped\" (Vigor 1975, 5) .

In an oft-cited speech for the Academy of Military Science in 2013, he spoke of \"blurring the distinctions between a state of war and peace\" (Gerasimov 2013) . Gerasimov was referring to the effectiveness of nonmilitary means whose destruction and impact can have effects comparable to a real war. The blurring boundaries of war and peace is a repetition of earlier theorists' ideas, notably Gareyev's. Gerasimov saw that \"the very 'rules of war'\" were changing and that conventional military means might be used only in a later, final stage (Gerasimov 2013 ). The next year, Gerasimov termed this \"the adaptive approach to the use of force\" (Gerasimov 2014a ).

The Soviet way of classifying just and unjust wars was manifold and changed over time, but the essence of the view in Soviet ideology was straightforward: Soviet wars were just, and imperialist wars were not. The just and unjust wars were in turn divided into different subtypes depending on the period, but in Soviet textbooks the customary taxonomy was as follows. Just wars were those in defense of the motherland and socialist countries, revolutionary wars of the working classes, wars of national liberation, and wars in defense of imperialist aggression. Unjust wars were imperialist aggression directed at socialist states, wars between the exploiting classes and the working class, colonial wars, and aggressive imperialist wars within the capitalist system (Scott and Scott 1988, 34) . Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii thus argued that \"just wars of liberation are a countermeasure-i.e., they are waged to repel the armed violence of exploiters against the working people, that of foreign invaders, or that of colonialists against enslaved peoples.

He contended that this partly depended on technological development that enabled nonmilitary means to take a dangerous and \"practically violent\" character (Gareyev 2013b ).\nHowever, Gareyev seemed cautious of the logical extensions of his thoughts. He stated that if these actions truly are to be considered as war, then the world would be in a continual state of war, and this is a concept of war that Russia could not introduce unilaterally (Gareyev 2013b) . It is not a stretch for him to conclude that these new means would count as war. Rather than rebutting the intellectual merits of that argument, he countered them with a practical one. He argued that Russia could not itself introduce a new concept of war, which needed to be done multilaterally. However, this is not a fully persuasive argument.

What are the ramifications of this approach for policy and theory?\nOn the one hand, cross-domain coercion expands the continuum of options on the escalation ladder while minimising the scale of kinetic operations. As such, this approach seemingly increases strategic stability. By employing it, Russia can promote its interests without escalating to major war, mainly through shaping and manipulating the strategic behaviour of its adversaries using a repertoire of tools but without employing massive brute force. Even from a purely legalistic point of view, such a repertoire of coercive actions may fall short of qualifying as an act of war. Concern about the cascading effects in the cyber realm may also contribute to a higher self-restraint. On the other hand, a critical examination of Moscow's efforts to deter and compel may take theoretical-conceptual issue with several of its aspects that seem destabilising. The findings suggest that these risks undermining strategic stability seem to emanate from the conceptual challenges that Russian strategists have not yet elaborated on, or overlooked in the nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) realms.

The annexation of Crimea in 2014, the creation and command of insurgencies in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions of Eastern Ukraine, and the information warfare and subversion to influence the outcome of the 2016 US presidential election are the best-known examples. However, beyond that, Russia has pursued a wide range of provocative military actions and nonmilitary and subversive measures against European states and states that were formerly part of the Soviet Union in order to forward its national interests. Consequently, the 2018 US National Defense Strategy reelevated the threat from Russia and identified long-term strategic competition with Russia and China as the central challenges to US security (US Department of Defense 2018). Similarly, the UK Defence Committee concluded in its report after the illegal annexation of Crimea that the Russian use of asymmetrical warfare \"represents the most immediate threat to its NATO neighbours and other NATO Member States\" (UK Defence Committee 2014).\nIn the Western debate about Russian warfare, analysts have discussed concepts such as \"hybrid warfare, \" \"new-generation warfare, \" and the \"Gerasimov doctrine\" to describe Russia's pursuit of its political goals using the full spectrum of military and nonmilitary forms of conflict.

The digital-technological and cognitive-psychological elements of such a strike are interconnected. Consequently, Russia defines informational sovereignty as digital-cognitive independence and envisions international regulation of the informational (cyber) space in a much broader sense than the West. 24 Informational struggle is not a codified concept of operations. However, its characteristics are straightforwardly identifiable. First, Russia's approach to informational struggle is holistic, that is, it merges digital-technological and cognitive-psychological attacks. While digital sabotage aims at disrupting a state's managerial capacity, psychological subversion aims at deceiving the victim, discrediting the leadership, and disorienting and demoralising the population and the military.

However, they are often contrarily seen by the Russian leadership as escalation, although by nonmilitary means. Indeed, as I have argued elsewhere, \"Russia believes itself to be in a war with the West, albeit, for now, a non-military one\" (Jonsson 2017a) . The inability to grasp the Russian leadership's understanding gives Western states a disadvantage both in negotiating potential solutions with Russia and deterring Russia, which is now the focus of NATO and the United States and is channeled through the European Reassurance Initiative and the European Deterrence Initiative with their budget of over $10 billion. Gauging the Russian understanding of war is thus crucial for handling the conflict with Russia, both in terms of how Russia will fight and how it will react to Western actions.\nThe most notable means accounting for this change in the Russian understanding of war is information warfare, particularly information-psychological warfare, and the creation of color revolutions. Both of these are understood as nonviolent but are seen as so effective that they could amount to violence and blur the boundary between war and peace. Nonviolent color revolutions, largely depending on information warfare, are seen as the West's main approach to the use of force.

Political war was famously used by George Kennan at the outset of the Cold War against the Soviet Union when he called for \"the employment of all the means at a nation's command, short of war, to achieve its national objectives\" (Kennan 1948) . This emphasizes the problem at the center of the term. As argued by Hoffman, \"If all wars are political in their purpose (as the famous Prussian soldier-scholar Carl von Clausewitz insisted), \" and if war is defined by violence, then \"there is no warfare in these political and economic activities, which is why the term is an oxymoron\" (Hoffman 2014) .\nIndeed, in a follow-up book, Galeotti addressed the contradictions in the Russian debate and the criticism of the term \"political war. \" First, he correctly noted that \"time and time again, military writers flirted with the notion of war without open fighting\" (Galeotti 2019, 30) . Galeotti then argued that Russians \"believe that the nature of war is changing, and in ways which mean the use of direct force may not always or initially be a central element to the conflict\" (Galeotti 2019, 30) .

The difference in values is an integral part of this, wherein Russia sees the need both to internally strengthen the support for its own model and spiritual renewal and to isolate foreign actors' abilities to influence it. The 2000 Information Security Doctrine explicitly formulated unsuccessful government control of the media as a threat. This securitization is the background against which both traditional and social media came under governmental, or government-friendly, control.\nThe imminent sense of threat among the Russian leaders has also been an essential part of the Russian conduct of information warfare. Because it perceived it lost the First Chechen War due to a lack of morale, which came from open traditional media and the free movement of journalists in the conflict zone, the leadership restricted broadcasting and used loyal journalists in the Second Chechen War. Because Russia felt it lost the global information battle in the war in Georgia, it significantly increased Sputnik (a government-run international news agency) and RT's international operations. Because it believed the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 were organized on social media, the leadership increased restrictions and created its own organization (the Internet Research Agency) to combat grassroots dissent internationally. To be clear, this is not to make a justification for Russian information operations-simply to give the context in which they evolved.\nThe importance of information warfare, and particularly

(Lenin 1915, 219) This became the foundation for defining war in the Soviet Union. It is important to note that Lenin himself added \"violent\" and did not use Clausewitz's formal definition that \"war is thus an act of force to compel the enemy to do your will\" (Clausewitz 1991, 29) . Furthermore, Lenin also expanded Clausewitz's definition in ways not intended by him and criticized Clausewitz for treating policy as the foreign policy interests of a unitary state. Rather, for Lenin, \"war is a reflection of the internal policy conducted by the given country before the war\" (Lenin 1919, 152) . In this way, Lenin was criticizing both Clausewitz and Hegel, who viewed the state as in an \"impartial position above the struggle of particular interests in society\" (Gat 1992, 372) .\nLike Lenin, Trotsky also saw violence as the defining feature of war. In a discussion at the Military Science Society, he stated that even though \"the artificial milieu, or human technology, in the broad sense of the word, has transfigured war just as it has transfigured all other human relations . . . this most general basis [of war] remains unchanged.

The second highlights the emergence of conventional and informational (cyber) deterrence theories and describes their merging with the earlier, nuclear deterrence concept into the current 'cross-domain coercion' construct. The third draws on cultural explanations to examine the innovativeness of the Russian concept. The conclusion offers theoretical and practical insights.\nThe current Russian variation on the theme of cross-domain coercion can be grasped only within its conceptual pretext and context. The Russian concept of deterring conventional aggression by nuclear weapons, which emerged during the 1990s, has been the intellectual pretext of the current approach. The Russian exploration of the changing character of war, under the rubric 'NGW', has been its intellectual context. This exploration gathered momentum following the 2008 War in Georgia, against the backdrop of the Russian conventional military reform. An understanding of these paradigmatic changes in Russian thinking, including the role of modern informational (cyber) warfare, is essential for grasping the current wave of Russian theory and practice of coercion. This section examines both.\nSince the Soviet collapse, two strategies of nuclear deterrence gradually emerged in Russia.

This passage is interesting since it constructs Russia's economic crisis as a deliberate form of warfare inflicted by the West, and especially the United States, to weaken Russia.

In this definition, war is an instrument of politics. There was a clear grasp of this among Soviet leaders. Also, its opposite was true: Peace was also an instrument of politics. This meant that both peace and war were seen as instruments, to be applied when suitable without any particular moral barrier between them, to further the goals of the Soviet Union.\nLenin's definition carried through major works throughout the Soviet period, for instance, Sokolovsky's Voyennaya strategiya and Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii, the authoritative Soviet book on war. They both stated that war was defined by armed force and explicitly did not include nonmilitary means.\nEven though this view was prevalent, it was challenged in the late 1960s. Some theorists argued that seeing war as an armed struggle did not exhaust the concept of war but rather needed to include the other means of influencing the enemy. The definition of war started to shift modestly at the end of the Soviet Union.

{"id":"046f04af090c144a8bd1403c6c5879a4","chunk":" communism, something that presupposed war, according to Lenin. In this sense, Marxist thought contained a paradox of war as an evil that could be fully eradicated only by war. The Soviet understanding of war meant that wars conducted by the Soviet Union were always just, by virtue of their sociopolitical character. Consequently, concepts such as self-defense and aggression were not decided upon based on the particular actions of states, such as invasion, but the goal they could serve. After the advent of nuclear weapons, Khrushchev argued that wars were not inevitable anymore, a view that persisted until the end of the Soviet Union.\nThe understanding of the nature of war thus remained constant throughout the Soviet Union. Lenin's main definition of war, as the continuation of politics by violent means, remained in the authoritative works throughout this period. The definition was almost identical to that of Clausewitz, but Lenin emphasized the class nature of politics, seeing war as the continuation of class politics by violent means. This, in the Soviet view, went beyond Clausewitz's narrow focus on a unitary state and its foreign policy and better reflected the relations between classes and the ownership of the means of production within states. In this definition, war is an instrument of politics. There was a clear grasp of this among Soviet leaders. Also, its opposite was true: Peace was also an instrument of politics.

This view of perpetual conflict was confirmed by Frunze, one of the most acclaimed Soviet military theorists and commissar for the army and navy in 1925, who saw that \"between our proletarian state and all the rest of the bourgeois world there can be only a state of long, stubborn, desperate war to the death\" (Frunze 1921, 30 ; see also Svechin 1927, 91) . Byely et al. (1972, 32) recapitulated that \"wars are . . . a constant traveling companion to capitalism. \"\nLenin understood war as having more utility than Marx and Engels. He held that \"the victory of socialism in one country does not at one stroke eliminate all war in general. On the contrary, it presupposes wars\" (Lenin 1916b, 2) . Thus, in Lenin's view, war was necessary in the condition of transforming the world and reaching the ultimate good. For Soviet leaders, \"the socialistic transformation of society without an armed struggle was unconceivable\" (Lider 1977, 232) . This struggle was not limited to an interstate-level; rather, it was militarizing the whole of social life (Lenin 1916b, 3) because the success of socialism in one country would not only create friction but also direct attempts by the bourgeoisie to crush the socialist

He took Clausewitz's classical dictum that \"war is merely a continuation of politics by other means\" (Clausewitz 1991, 42) , with its implication that war is an instrument of policy, and put it at the core of Soviet military theory:\nWith reference to wars, the main thesis of dialectics is that \"war is simply the continuation of politics by other (i.e., violent) means. \" Such is the formula of Clausewitz, one of the greatest writers on the history of war, whose thinking was stimulated by Hegel.

The importance of information-technical warfare increased after the Gulf War, when Iraqi troops relying on Soviet mat\u00e9riel and doctrines were defeated by a technologically superior, but numerically inferior, US military. The importance of the information-psychological sphere increased during the Chechen wars.\nThe perceived threat from color revolutions is analyzed in chapter 4. The color revolutions contained a degree of Western nonmilitary support, which mainly consisted of the work of NGOs, political and diplomatic support, and financial support for democracy and human rights. As opposition groups in the color revolution states rallied under the banner of democracy and human rights and were supported by Western countries (mainly the United States), the color revolutions became seen by Russian political and military elites as an instrument for engineering regime change.

This became the central definition of war in the Soviet Union.\nSoviet theorists were keen to distinguish themselves from Clausewitz in another sense too. In their view, Clausewitz's description of war as an instrument of politics was both incorporated into Soviet thought but also criticized, as it implied that war was the result of voluntary decisions (Lider 1977, 249) . Marx had \"shown the folly of such a view by demonstrating that behavior is rooted in the material base, that is in the system of production and the socio-economic structure\" (Lider 1977, 249) . In other words, the Clausewitzian view of war failed to acknowledge the automaticity in Soviet thought, in which the material base inevitably led to wars.\nUp until the 1960s, Soviet military theorist Aleksandr Kalistratov saw broad agreement to treat armed conflict and war synonymously; war meant a \"social armed struggle\" or \"an armed struggle in a class society\" (Kalistratov 2004, 150) .

Modern warfare is a qualitatively new phenomenon\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 13) . While criticizing the Clausewitzian definitions in the two volumes, the authors still insisted that \"the main form of struggle [in war] was and remains the armed struggle\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) . From this duality, it is hard to draw any clear conclusions, but it is noteworthy to compare these thoughts to Chekinov's later reasoning.\nThe nature of modern war was also addressed by Vladimir Kvachkov, a GRU colonel and a fellow at Center for Military-Strategic Studies. 2 He argued, similarly to Kalistratov, that the traditional concept of war focusing on armed warfare and the destruction of the enemy as the only way to achieve victory was too narrow (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) . In this conception of war, nonmilitary means are omitted and could not grasp the Cold War, the \"undeclared\" Afghan war, or \"restoring constitutional order in Chechnya\" (Kvachkov 2004, 3.1) .

Revolution can be seen as the link between the class struggle and war (Peralta 2005, 95) .\nThe perception of war as having the potential to speed up the revolutionary process was strengthened by the First World War and the following Russian Revolution when the Bolsheviks came to power and by the Second World War when the Soviet Union established control over half of Central Europe (Light 1988, 21) . Byely et al. (1972, 15) stated that war could also delay or hasten the development of the class society. Here it is useful to add the context of the development of military theory in the early days of the Soviet Union. In a passage of history less remembered by Western states than in the Soviet Union, Britain, France, and the United States were involved in the Russian Civil War, supporting the White movement against the Bolsheviks (Glantz 1992, 9) . Thus, the foundational policy and military doctrine of the Soviet Union matured in the context of an \"internal struggle and foreign intervention [that] threatened the fledgling Bolshevik regime's existence\" (Glantz 1992, 5) .\nAt the core of the Marxist view of war was thus a paradox.

{"id":"cb292470c7cc7ca5b848504c1662c302","chunk":" armed struggle was \"the main type of confrontation in wars, \" and he saw that \"armed conflict is the use of military means\" (Orlyansky 2002, 42) . Orlyansky then discussed how informatization improved the conduct of armed forces but also saw opportunities for a new way to affect an adversary, through the use of software (Orlyansky 2002, 45) . Nonetheless, he saw that \"the essence and objectives of [the information] struggle remain unchangedonly its means, content, forms and methods in various spheres of public life are improved\" (Orlyansky 2002, 46) . This led Orlyansky to conclude that the arguments that saw the information struggle as violent reflect a misunderstanding that brought confusion to the Russian military debate (Orlyansky 2002, 46) .

Western attention revived anew in the 2010s as Russia again became a central concern for international security, by which time Russia's political and military realities and military thought had changed notably.\nWhile the NATO and EU states see a new threat from a resurgent and aggressive Russia, Russian leaders, from military strategists up to President Vladimir Putin himself, believe that their regime's survival is threatened by Western subversion. From their perspective, prodemocracy movements such as the 2013-14 Euromaidan uprising in Ukraine have been engineered by the West's use of nonmilitary means of conflict, and Russia sees itself as responding to the threat of \"controlled 'color' revolution\" (Putin 2014a) . Gen. Valery Gerasimov, chief of the Russian General Staff, stated that \"during the past decade, a wave of these 'color revolutions' has been instigated by the U.S. in the post-Soviet space, North Africa and the Middle East\" (Gerasimov 2014a, 15) . Furthermore, the sanctions that the United States and the EU imposed on Russia beginning in 2014 were understood by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as an attempt to create \"regime change\" in Russia (Reuters 2014) and by the head of Russia's second-largest bank as amounting to \"economic war\" (TASS ","chunk_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407","document_ids":["9a3a530c99afa34c673c3e3167b92514"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"RED ARMY\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Red Army was a significant military force in the past, but its threat has diminished.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"NATO\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"NATO is a political and military alliance of North American and European countries that views Russia as a new threat.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"EU\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The EU is a political and economic union of European countries that shares NATO's concerns about Russia.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"RUSSIA\"","type":"\"GEO\"","description":"\"Russia has become a central concern for international security in the 2010s due to its perceived resurgence and aggression.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"VLADIMIR PUTIN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Vladimir Putin is the President of Russia and believes that his regime's survival is threatened by Western subversion.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"VALERY GERASIMOV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Valery Gerasimov is the chief of the Russian General Staff and believes that the U.S. has instigated 'color revolutions' in various regions.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"},{"name":"\"SERGEI LAVROV\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Sergei Lavrov is the Russian foreign minister who views sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU as an attempt to create 'regime change' in Russia.\"","source_id":"48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;RED ARMY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Red Army was a significant military force in the past, but its threat has diminished.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;NATO&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"NATO is a political and military alliance of North American and European countries that views Russia as a new threat.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;EU&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The EU is a political and economic union of European countries that shares NATO's concerns about Russia.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIA&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"GEO\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Russia has become a central concern for international security in the 2010s due to its perceived resurgence and aggression.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;VLADIMIR PUTIN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Vladimir Putin is the President of Russia and believes that his regime's survival is threatened by Western subversion.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;VALERY GERASIMOV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Valery Gerasimov is the chief of the Russian General Staff and believes that the U.S. has instigated 'color revolutions' in various regions.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;SERGEI LAVROV&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Sergei Lavrov is the Russian foreign minister who views sanctions imposed by the U.S. and EU as an attempt to create 'regime change' in Russia.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">48992c1ff17a8a786ad467a773402407<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

The consequence Malyshev saw for an expansion of the concept of war was that the lack of the regulatory function of war and peace, restraining and permitting different behavior in different times, would be lost.

This made the understanding of the essence of war essentially static during the existence of the Soviet Union. In analyzing war, Soviet military theorists were working in a distinct tradition based on dialectical materialism, a holistic view of politics and war, and their special focus on history, all deriving from Marxism-Leninism. The holistic approach to war remains a key feature for understanding Russian thinking today.\nThe root cause of war in the Soviet view was the existence of class and exploitative societies, which were inherently aggressive. Private ownership of the means of production led to class antagonisms that pushed states into aggressive action and inevitably caused wars. This is the context for how the notion of the Soviet Union as a besieged fortress took hold. The only remedy to the inevitable existence of war was thus the transformation of the world to communism, something that presupposed war, according to Lenin. In this sense, Marxist thought contained a paradox of war as an evil that could be fully eradicated only by war. The Soviet understanding of war meant that wars conducted by the Soviet Union were always just, by virtue of their sociopolitical character. Consequently, concepts such as self-defense and aggression were not decided upon based on the particular actions of states, such as invasion, but the goal they could serve.

Russian writings offer a good glimpse into when, how, and against what targets nuclear weapons might be used. Russian deliberations on the threat posed by theater US missile defense to these calibrated escalation approaches also telegraph one of the likely potential counters to single or grouped strikes. In general, the US should seek to deter specific escalation approaches either by shaping the means the Russian military intend to use, the resilience of the targets their stratagem seeks to attack, or their confidence levels.\nRussian military strategies offer important insights into potential triggers for escalation, thresholds which the adversary believes relevant for transition in either the period of conflict or the type of war they are fighting. These are useful in considering US escalation management strategies. How the US chooses to employ its own \"strategic conventional\" arsenal will prove of immense consequence in the Russian leadership's selection of their available courses of action.

This is interesting to read in parallel with Putin's yearly address to the Federal Assembly in April 2007, a week after Markov's interview: Some, making skillful use of pseudo-democratic rhetoric, would like to return us to the recent past, some in order to once again plunder the nation's resources with impunity and rob the people and the state, and others in order to deprive our country of its economic and political independence. There has been an increasing influx of money from abroad being used to intervene directly in our internal affairs. Looking back at the more distant past, we recall the talk about the civilising role of colonial powers during the colonial era. Today, \"civilisation\" has been replaced by democratisation, but the aim is the same-to ensure unilateral gains and one's own advantage, and to pursue one's own interests.

Svechin argued, along with Lenin and Clausewitz, that politics are necessarily superior to strategy; Tukhachevsky argued that strategy should be protected from interference from policymakers. For Svechin, \"it is natural for strategy to try to gain emancipation from bad politics, but strategy cannot exist in a vacuum without politics and is condemned to for all the sins of politics\" (Svechin 1927, 85) .

He wrote an article in Foreign Affairs in 1959 introducing the concept to the American audience. Khrushchev argued that there were two ways to deal with a neighbor one dislikes: war (which in the age of atomic and hydrogen weapons of mass destruction would be dire for all) or peaceful coexistence (Khrushchev 1959) . Peaceful coexistence was not an absence of conflict and disagreement but more a recognition that different systems should compete by their respective strengths rather than by war. Or, in less friendly words, \"peaceful coexistence is conceived as a form of the international class struggle for the ultimate victory of socialism waged without the use of arms\" (Lider 1977, 251) .

As such, even if innovative for the reasons outlined above, they reflect not a change but continuity in Russian strategic culture.\nWestern scholars sometimes see the innovativeness of the Russian approach as its being uninterrupted, in contrast to the Western division between wartime and peacetime. 65 Indeed, the Russian approach is much broader than its Western equivalent. Informational struggle is an uninterrupted strategic effort, waged during peacetime and wartime, in domestic, the adversary's and international spheres. Furthermore, deterrence, in Russian usage, refers to the use of force in peacetime, in crisis and in wartime, where it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion.

Rather, \"those guided by just aims would use just methods, and from their progressive aims would come just consequences. The problem of evaluating means and results was therefore of negligible importance\" (Lider 1977, 221) . Vigor demonstrated this using the example of British-French aggression in Crimea in the 1850s; even though they were both capitalist states and aggressors, Marx and Engels supported them (Vigor 1975, 61) . The key reason for this was that they thought the war would help to bring about the fall of the czar. Vigor thus concluded that in the Soviet view there is no \"objective\" definition of aggression or self-defense. Rather, even if a capitalist country is clearly attacked first, it would not have the moral right to self-defense, and the aggression would not be condemnable if it was taken to further the revolutionary process (Vigor 1975, 60, 62, 64) .\nIn the same manner as the justness of a war, the distinction between offense and defense was not decided by particular actions but rather by the sociopolitical constitution of states.

To support this, he referred to the only time when nuclear weapons have been used, at Hiroshima and Nagasaki; both cases made it clear that they served US policy (Gareyev 1998, 20) . This brought Gareyev into line with the Clausewitzian and Soviet distinction of how the nature of war remains, while its character shifts. Another area of continuity with Soviet understanding in Gareyev's thinking is the causes of war, which he saw as economic, even if they were \"disguised as religious, ideological, and other motives\" (Gareyev 1998, 19) . The causes of wars, Gareyev argued, were \"the struggle for territorial gains, natural resources, wealth and manpower (slaves); attempts by conquerors to subdue other nations or even establish world domination; the seizure of colonies, and their expansion, raw materials and spheres of economic and political influence\" (Gareyev 1998, 22) .\nFurthermore, Gareyev contended that the main source of conflict in the near future will be the struggle for raw materials and survival (Gareyev 1998, 26) .

He concluded by stating that with the \"increase in importance of nonmilitary measures in resolving interstate contradictions, the role of the Armed Forces in ensuring the country's security does not decrease but only increases\" (Gerasimov 2016a) .\nThe key takeaways from the article are that Gerasimov is using the same argument about the changing character of armed struggle to emphasize longrange precision weapons rather than nonmilitary means as before. Thereafter, however, he focused again on the importance of nonmilitary and asymmetrical means for waging modern wars.

This most likely reflected the loss of the Soviet Union's conventional superiority over the West (Fitzgerald 1994, 178) .

It is structured chronologically, covering three decades (the 1990s, the 2000s, and the 2010s) to show the development over time.

However, this is not a fully persuasive argument. It would seem he was reaching for a legal\/practical way to avoid what he reasoned theoretically. That is to say, if the progress of technology and society has allowed nonmilitary means to be seen as violent, then there is a case for including them in the concept of war if war is defined by violence.\nGareyev followed up the same train of thought in a 2016 article. He stated that \"war itself was understood primarily as a continuation of politics by means of armed violence, \" even though \"nonmilitary forms of confrontation were widely used\" (Gareyev 2016) . This was also the understanding of war reflected in the federal law On Defense (Gareyev 2016) .

The conference included a comprehensive view of the top elites in Russian national and military security. Putin's introductory remarks added little to earlier statements but underlined his view that color revolutions were being used to \"impose home-grown formulae and values on other peoples\" (Putin 2014b, 6) . Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu also emphasized values, stating that color revolutions were becoming \"a major factor in destabilization of the situation in many countries of the world. Foreign values are being imposed on peoples under guise of expanding democracy\" (Shoigu 2014, 10) . Foreign powers were seen to exploit local problems. Notably, Shoigu saw information warfare and the use of special forces as primary resources (Shoigu 2014, 10) . He argued that where \"regime change proves impossible, the conditions are created for armed confrontation\" (Shoigu 2014, 10) . Thus, in Shoigu's view, color revolutions were a two-step approach, where the first would be seen as nonmilitary (as in Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan), followed by military intervention if the first step did not succeed (as in Serbia, Libya, and Syria) (Shoigu 2014, 10) .

For Soviet leaders, \"the socialistic transformation of society without an armed struggle was unconceivable\" (Lider 1977, 232) . This struggle was not limited to an interstate-level; rather, it was militarizing the whole of social life (Lenin 1916b, 3) because the success of socialism in one country would not only create friction but also direct attempts by the bourgeoisie to crush the socialist state's victorious proletariat (Lenin 1916b, 2) . Frunze agreed, arguing that \"absolutely all aspects of social life are absorbed by war and subordinated to them\" (Frunze 1921, 28) . Consolidating the internal front was seen, in the Marxist-Leninist view, as a key condition for the ability to conduct external battles (Peralta 2005, 116) . In this sense, Lenin was mindful of both interstate war and revolution, a key concept in Marxist-Leninist thought. Revolution can be seen as the link between the class struggle and war (Peralta 2005, 95) .\nThe perception of war as having the potential to speed up the revolutionary process was strengthened by the First World War and the following Russian Revolution when the Bolsheviks came to power and by the Second World War when the Soviet Union established control over half of Central Europe (Light 1988, 21","chunk_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b","document_ids":["ae8da0fd968c2e9bd598c2792e5638a5"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"SOVIET LEADERS\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"Soviet leaders are mentioned as holding a belief that socialistic transformation requires armed struggle.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"LENIN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Lenin is cited as a key figure in Marxist-Leninist thought, emphasizing the connection between war and revolution.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"FRUNZE\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Frunze agrees with the idea that all aspects of social life are absorbed by war.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"BOLSHEVIKS\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Bolsheviks came to power during the Russian Revolution.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"SOVIET UNION\"","type":"\"ORGANIZATION\"","description":"\"The Soviet Union established control over half of Central Europe during World War II.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"FIRST WORLD WAR\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The First World War influenced the perception of war's potential to accelerate revolution.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"RUSSIAN REVOLUTION\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The Russian Revolution saw the Bolsheviks come to power.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"},{"name":"\"SECOND WORLD WAR\"","type":"\"EVENT\"","description":"\"The Second World War solidified the Soviet Union's control over Central Europe.\"","source_id":"14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;SOVIET LEADERS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Soviet leaders are mentioned as holding a belief that socialistic transformation requires armed struggle.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;LENIN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Lenin is cited as a key figure in Marxist-Leninist thought, emphasizing the connection between war and revolution.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;FRUNZE&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Frunze agrees with the idea that all aspects of social life are absorbed by war.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;BOLSHEVIKS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Bolsheviks came to power during the Russian Revolution.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;SOVIET UNION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Soviet Union established control over half of Central Europe during World War II.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;FIRST WORLD WAR&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The First World War influenced the perception of war's potential to accelerate revolution.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RUSSIAN REVOLUTION&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Russian Revolution saw the Bolsheviks come to power.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;SECOND WORLD WAR&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"EVENT\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"The Second World War solidified the Soviet Union's control over Central Europe.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">14442faf092eaecae58a72c1a981a33b<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

It furthermore demonstrates how the Russian understanding of the color revolutions changed among political elites from being seen as mostly spontaneous events to a central threat to the Russian government. This is an integral part of the shift in military elites' understanding of war, which sees nonmilitary and nonviolent means becoming more important than military ones. The color revolutions were understood as a way in which Western states-in the beginning mainly the United States-could engineer regime change in hostile states with nonmilitary means. This was achieved via information warfare, NGOs, youth organizations, promotion of Western values, and diplomatic pressure. With these tools, Western states were perceived to destabilize a society, generating a popular uprising in the name of democracy that, when successful, led to citizens overthrowing their ruling regime.\nAt the outset of the color revolutions, they were not seen as nonmilitary warfare by Western governments. Rather, this understanding developed gradually. Among the Russian political elites from 2004 up until the 2007-8 elections in Russia, the threat of color revolutions was increasingly securitized, but it was seen to come from NGOs and the Russian opposition.

Furthermore, deterrence, in Russian usage, refers to the use of force in peacetime, in crisis and in wartime, where it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion. This probably explains why the Russian discourse does not differentiate between deterrence, compellence and coercion and uses them interchangeably or under the rubric of deterrence. This, however, more reflects the uniqueness rather than the innovativeness of the Russian approach.\nThe Russian discourse often uses the term 'struggle' (bor'ba) to refer to various forms of strategic interactions. For example, the military dictionary includes terms like 'informational struggle', 'radio-electronic struggle', 'diplomatic struggle', 'ideological struggle', 'economic struggle' or 'armed struggle'. 66 In Russian military theory, the term has a broad meaning and refers to strategic interaction in its totality, in both wartime and peacetime. In terms of efforts to impose one's strategic will, this binary division only refers to the intensity of the competition, but not to its essence. Competition with the adversary is seen as protracted, occurring towards, during and following kinetic phases of interaction.

Although scholars should examine and measure an actor's modus operandi in a more idiosyncratic manner, they also naturally seek a sound parsimonious theory to deal with certain paradigmatic situations. For this task, an analytical framework of strategic culture and ideational explanations may be useful for clarifying puzzling operational choices and counterintuitive conceptualisations. The ability to explore and understand the interplay between national security aspirations, strategic culture and military tradition is crucial to anyone seeking to engage Moscow, or any other actor, on a host of geopolitical issues.

Similarly, a joint report by the United Kingdom's Conflict Studies Research Centre and Moscow State University's Institut Problem Informatsionnoy Bezopasnosti (Information Security Institute) emphasized that the main difference between the Russian and Western understandings of information security is that the Russian understanding includes the content of information, whereas the Western focuses on the infrastructure for its transmission (CSRC 2012, 27) .\nIn the Russian language there are three main terms for information warfare: informatsionnaya voina (information war), informatsionnoye protivoborstvo (information confrontation, although protivborstvo is often used to mean information war), and informatsionnaya borba (information struggle) (Thomas 2011, 138 ; see also its appendix on definitions, 365-74). Timothy Thomas found that the most authoritative way of understanding information warfare in the General Staff was that information warfare is a way of resolving a conflict between opposing sides. The goal is for one side to gain and hold an information advantage over the other. This is achieved by exerting a specific information\/psychological and information\/technical influence on a nation's decision-making system, on the nation's populous [sic] and on its information resource structures, as well as by defeating the enemy's control system and his information resource structures with the help of additional means, such as nuclear assets, weapons and electronic assets.

It continued, like the 1993 doctrine, to explain war with armed conflict in parentheses. It noted that \"the nature of modern wars and armed conflicts is determined by their military-political goals, the means of achieving these goals, and the scale of military operations\" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.2).\nIn the paragraph describing modern wars, the doctrine reads that they affect all spheres of human activity and include \"the extensive use of indirect, non-close quarter and other (including non-traditional) forms and methods of operation\" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.3). Furthermore, there was a desire on both sides to \"disrupt the system of state and military command and control\" (Ministry of Defense 2000, point II.3).

Thereafter, the questions got more attention, but they were still far from mainstream. In general, the extent of Western analytical engagement with Russian military thought, both in terms of number of analysts and frequency of publications, has been linked to perceptions of Russian military capabilities and their use. The analysis in the late 2000s and early 2010s mostly confirmed how difficult it would be for Russia to reform, and the debate centered on Russia's military means (see, e.g., Vendil Pallin 2009; Bukkvoll 2009; Baev 2010; Renz 2010; Bartles 2011; McDermott 2011a; McDermott, Nygren, and Vendil Pallin 2012; Renz and Thornton 2012; Klein 2012; Giles 2012a ).

However, its effect on elites and doctrines is not significant enough to conclude that it has changed the nature of war.\nThe fundamental novelty in the understanding of the nature of war is, rather, information-psychological warfare. As the information arena is key for domestic and international power, information-psychological warfare is seen to be so effective that it can alter the consciousness of a country, eroding trust in public institutions and state policy to the degree that the citizens are prepared to revolt, creating color revolutions. In this way, information warfare is understood to be more effective than military force and able to reach strategic goals by itself. Several Russian theorists and elites see that information should be considered violent and that Russia is in an ongoing information war. Therefore, information warfare is seen to blur the boundaries between war and peace.\nA crucial difference between the Russian and Western threat perceptions has been that the Russian view includes the content of information as a threat, whereas the Western view has, at least up until recently, focused on the free flow of information. It is because of this understanding of information warfare that the Russian threat perception has been notably broad, including everything from the influence on the mass consciousness and social and state stability to values of patriotism.

They emphasized cooperation with the West and blamed the involvement in the color revolutions indirectly on NGOs rather than directly on Western governments. The Russian leadership's first reaction to the Rose and Tulip Revolutions was mild, whereas the Orange Revolution was met more harshly. Indeed, Putin made no mention at the time of foreign involvement in the revolution in Kyrgyzstan while speaking at a press conference on March 25, 2005. Rather, he stated that he was not surprised by the revolution and saw that it was a result of weak authorities and accumulated socioeconomic problems (Putin 2005b) .\nA notable change in the Russian government's public statements came in late 2005 and early 2006.

This book shows that the threat of color revolutions increased notably on the political agenda in the period 2004-6, but it took until 2012-14 for them to become mainstream among Russian military theorists.\nThe broadening of the Russian understanding of war has been a long-term evolutionary process. This is to be seen in contrast to reoccurring calls for a revolution in Russian military thought and practice, often heard after the invasion of Ukraine or the interference in the US election. Rather than expounding novel ideas, it is the Western lack of attention to Russian military thought that makes them seem novel. In fact, many of the most publicized notionsthe blurring of war and peace, that Russia is in an information war, that information can be a weapon, that nonmilitary means can be as effective as nuclear weapons-have been a part of the Russian military-theoretical debate long before the invasion of Ukraine. Moreover, the attention that was paid to Russian military thought had to a large degree focused on the modernization of conventional capabilities and less on the unconventional ones.\nWith the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Western interest in Russian military thought was on a steady decline until the 2008 war between Georgia and Russia and the concomitant reform of the Russian Armed Forces.

Thus, they seem less certain that they agreed with the idea of war as armed struggle. They contended that a new form of war (controlled chaos \/ color revolutions) had emerged and that nonmilitary means have changed the nature of armed struggle.\nIn early 2016, Gerasimov's yearly speech for the Academy of Military Sciences discussed Syria. He started by arguing that \"the rapid development of science and technology is changing the nature of armed struggle\" (Gerasimov 2016a) . For him, \"the main way to achieve the goals is remote, contactless impact on the enemy due to the massive use of high-precision and long-range weapons from air, sea, and space\" (Gerasimov 2016a ). This argument is very similar to those expounded by Slipchenko. Later in the article he contended that \"in modern conflicts, the methods of struggle are increasingly shifting toward the integrated application of political, economic, information, and other nonmilitary measures implemented with reliance on military force. These are the so-called hybrid methods\" (Gerasimov 2016a ).

It is because of this understanding of information warfare that the Russian threat perception has been notably broad, including everything from the influence on the mass consciousness and social and state stability to values of patriotism. This is also the background against which the domestic Russian media was claimed to be a part of a propaganda war against the Russian state during the First Chechen War.\nThe impact of the information-psychological sphere can be seen in that a large number of central theorists and political elites have argued that Russia is in an information war with the West. Some have contended that the dissolution of the Soviet Union was actually due to a successful information campaign from the West. Notably, Kartapolov and Burenok saw that information warfare was a key means for the West to create the Euromaidan uprising, which led to, in the Russian rhetoric, a civil war.

For example, a 2006 Russian Academy of Sciences study argued that \"conducting large-scale military conflicts with conventional and\/or mass use of nuclear weapons is becoming pointless because the consequences of destroying infrastructure nodes (even singular) could lead to unexpected consequences.\" As examples, the study discussed the potential implications of damaging critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants or hydroelectric plants. 184 In 2009, Russian military analysts described research that showed the importance of finding key nodes (or, as others have called them, \"narrow spaces\" or \"keystones\" of key systems) of elements of the opponent's industrial systems that could serve as targets for conventional precision strike.

In a speech at the end of 2014 touching on the topic of hybrid war, he argued that it had been popular to accuse Russia of waging it in Crimea and Ukraine but that he \"would apply the term above to the United States and its war strategy-it is truly a hybrid war aimed not so much at defeating the enemy military as at changing the regimes in the states that pursue a policy Washington does not like\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). For Lavrov, this strategy consisted of \"using financial and economic pressure, information attacks, using others on the perimeter of a corresponding state as proxies and of course information and ideological pressure through externally financed non-governmental organisations\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). This strategy was, for Lavrov, also used directly against Russia.

In all cases, it is clear that the importance of information warfare had increased significantly among Russian theorists.\nIndeed, while Russian offensive actions recently have been analyzed, Russian elites' threat perception \"remains relatively neglected by observers\" (Pigman 2019, 22) . The lack of attention to Russian views makes analysts also miss the extent to which Russian threat perception is the backdrop to Russian offensive action. For example, the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections were seen to have been largely mobilized and coordinated on social media.

This instrumentalization was one reason why the Russian leadership came to see democracy promotion as a geopolitical tool where it suited US interests.\nAnother factor that supported the view that the color revolutions were created by the United States is that the Bush administration included the \"democratic revolutions in Georgia, Lebanon, Ukraine and Kyrgyzstan\" in a list of President Bush's accomplishments (Deyermond 2015, 33; White House 2005) . Similarly, incumbent rulers in the color revolution states blamed Western forces. Shevardnadze in Georgia called the revolution a coup caused by USfunded election monitors, who had diminished the authority of the elections, and by George Soros's Open Society Institute (OSI), which had financed youth and media organizations, fomenting revolution (Horvath 2011, 3) . The Leonid Kuchma government in Ukraine saw international organizations and Western officials' statements and support for NGOs as foreign interference in internal affairs (Sushko and Prystako 2006, 126) .

Hence, the political, social, and economic aims pursued in these wars are just and noble, while the armed violence is legitimate, justified\" (Byely et al. 1972, 7) .\nSoviet ideology held that all wars stemmed from class struggle and that the only wars that could be just were those working toward its abolition, which the Soviet wars in whatever form did by virtue of their sociopolitical character (Miller 1964, 268) . Thus, Soviet wars were legitimate because of what the Soviet Union was, not what it did. The moral thinking was based on a systematic character rather than particular actions. This view is notable since it made concepts such as justness in the means of fighting (jus in bello) aggression and self-defense less relevant (key concepts in Western just war theory).

The ability of these forces to carry out strategic operations, that is their viability to succeed in a strategic aerospace operation or SODCIT, may constitute one of the criteria Russian military science uses to determine whether or not to escalate to nuclear use.\nPrecision-guided weapons-together with new means of intelligence, surveillance, target acquisition, and reconnaissance-have afforded the Russian military the ability to target key elements of an adversary's critical infrastructure. The emphasis is placed on targets whose destruction has the potential to create cascading effects on the system as a whole. The ultimate point of using conventional weapons against particular types of critical targets is to affect escalation management, creating a specific level of psychological coercion that will convince an adversary of the futility of further conflict, given any continued or potential escalation in damage. Of course targets may, and likely will, include those that have both a deterrent effect and practical military value should the conflict continue; that is, there are targets which may be considered dual purpose.\nMilitary writings generally divide targets based on their strategic significance and collateral effects.

Thus, the invasion of Finland in 1939, the deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba that led to the crisis of 1962, the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 were all considered defensive actions by Soviet military theorists and leaders (Scott and Scott 1988, 258) . This is not to argue that the Soviet ethics of justifying their own wars as legitimate in all circumstances is unique but rather to illustrate how the ethics of war are reflected in Soviet ideology.

The main novelty is that in essence, this approach is not a brute force but a coercion strategy. In contrast to traditional massive use of force, cross-domain coercion aims at manipulating the adversary's perception, decision-making and behaviour. This notion lies at the heart of NGW, which orchestrates the military and non-military measures while minimising kinetic engagements. Since Russian usage of the term 'deterrence' equally refers to the prevention of the threat from materialising, to deterrence in peacetime and to the use of force in crisis and in wartime, it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion aimed at shaping the battlefield dynamic. The quest to shape the strategic environment, whether in an active or reactive mode, is a departure from the big war paradigm that dominated Russian military thought for decades. This is not to say that Moscow has stopped massive operations maximising violence, but the choice to address threats mainly by coercively shaping the environment across domains to evaporate them is somewhat novel for the Russian military.\nSince NGW is less about traditional military destruction but rather targets the adversary's perception to affect its will and choices, the role of the informational domain looms unprecedentedly large.

In peacetime, this point is crossed when threats, instead of holding aggression in check, become so convincing that the adversary assumes that an attack is inevitable and decides to pre-empt. In intra-war coercion, it happens when force employment becomes so devastating that it incites the adversary, which feels cornered, and that it has nothing to lose, to escalate. In both cases, more is lost than is gained and the coercion programme becomes a self-defeating overreaction.\nThe policymaking discourse in Moscow and in the Western capitals is already rife with the mutual misperceptions, mirror imaging and attribution of non-existent intentions and capabilities. This may be due in part to the fact that Moscow is interacting with the West while its deterrence mechanism is not yet finalised and its theory and practice are constantly evolving. In part, it may be because the West engages Moscow with only a vague understanding of the conceptual foundations and perception of Russian strategists. A recommendation for policymakers would be to initiate academic exchanges and second-track activities with Russian defence intellectuals to co-explore theoretical constructs of deterrence and to co-share indigenous perceptions on the subject.

These are very interesting sentiments to compare to Bogdanov's later views (see below), as his focus at this time was how the use of conventional military means deliver a victory. It is furthermore worth noting that his thinking about future war is almost identical to Slipchenko's.\nSimilarly, Col. Sergei Chekinov, also from the Center for Military-Strategic Studies, who later coauthored several articles with Bogdanov, discussed modern wars with Col. Oleg Orekhov. Chekinov and Orekhov also explicitly drew upon Slipchenko's theories. They contended that \"aerospace attack and defense are becoming . . . the main weapon of twenty-first century wars, especially in the initial period of war\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 17) . They saw that \"the aerospace sphere is steadily increasing relative to actions in other spheres of armed struggle\" (Orekhov and Chekinov 2004, 14) .

However, it is worth remembering that not all writing about propaganda refers to the perceived threat from the West. The long-standing problem with terrorism in Russia, especially from the North Caucasus, has also played out in the information sphere. As described above, an integral part of the Chechens' strategy was their ability to conduct information operations, recruitment, and propaganda dissemination on the Internet. Nonetheless, it is clear that the main perpetrator of this information war against Russia was perceived to be the West.\nThe idea of Russia being in the middle of an information war has been shared by many Russian theorists since. For example, while commenting on relations with the EU over Ukraine, Aleksandr Mikhailov, a retired FSB major general, stated that information warfare has been going on since the birth of humanity (Pravda 2014). However, now technology has advanced so far that its potential has increased significantly. Regarding Russia being under attack, he saw that the goals of the enemy were obvious: \"a complete demoralisation of the Russian population and then the demoralisation of Russian authorities and administration\" (Pravda 2014).

The question is thus: Has the Russian understanding of the nature of war changed, and if so, how?\nIn order to answer this question, this book will investigate how the nature of war has developed in the views of Russian military theorists, political elites, and public security doctrines. Furthermore, this book will analyze the most notable nonmilitary means-information warfare and the creation of color revolutions-affecting the Russian understanding of war.\nQuestioning whether or not the nature of war was changing began anew in Russia in the mid-2000s. This was driven by two sets of revolutions: the revolution in information and communications technology (ICT) and the color revolutions. Color revolutions are seen by Russian theorists and elites as shorthand for Western-created uprisings through information warfare, ideological influence, prodemocracy movements, and nonviolent protest techniques combined with Western financial and diplomatic support. The military-theoretical discussions placed more emphasis on the increasing utility of nonmilitary means in relation to military means. Nonmilitary means refer to a mix of information, ideological, economic, subversive, and diplomatic means. However, while military theorists increasingly acknowledged the effectiveness of nonmilitary means, the view that such means might change the nature of war itself was not widespread among theorists and security doctrines at the time.\nRather, the most notable shift in the Russian understanding of war came in the period 2012-14.

The protesters rallied under calls for better relations with the West and \"Western values, \" and they received political support from Western governments. The pinnacle of the threat from color revolutions came with the Euromaidan revolt in Ukraine 2013-14, which the Russian leadership countered with an invasion of Ukraine and an illegal annexation of the Crimean peninsula.\nAs the second chapter concluded, the understanding of war in Russia had widened because of the increasing utility of nonmilitary means, most prominently information warfare and the threat of color revolutions.

The General Staff is also in charge of the journal Voyennaya Mysl (Military Thought), which has been running since the late nineteenth century (Voyennaya Mysl n.d.). It is the main outlet for military-theoretical works for both the General Staff and the Academy of Military Science. The journal publishes many of its works translated into English (although the volume and issue numbers sometimes differ).\nThe nature of war is understood as what war is, which has, as discussed above, traditionally been defined in Russia as armed violence for a political purpose. This book does not define other key terms a priori. Rather, it analyzes the way in which Russian political elites and military theorists use them, since the objective is to see how the Russian understanding has changed. Nonetheless, this can at times create difficulties in that theorists can be using different terms to refer to the same thing or the same terms to refer to different things.

Telling the opponent that their strategy won't work, or is dangerous because of the potential for uncontrolled escalation, is likely to confirm their thinking about the benefits of such stratagems. An informed dialogue, that reflects knowledge of the calculus behind Russian planning, may serve better in shaping the other side's confidence levels.\nIn thinking about escalation management, it does not appear that the Russian military is articulating a theory of victory in the same way that US doctrine envisions defeating an adversary. While Russian strategies aspire to terminate the conflict on favorable terms, the concepts underpinning Russian thinking on escalation management have several objectives: managing escalation at existing levels, keeping the conflict bounded, deterring additional participants from joining, and reducing the cohesion of opposing coalitions.\nRussian deterrence and warfighting concepts are extensions of a particular set of security and geopolitical concerns; they seek to deter hostilities, terminate a conflict, or prevent its escalation more than they seek to win it. During these attempts, the Russian state would seek to communicate to the United States and NATO the potential costs and ultimate futility of continuing armed aggression against Russian core security interests. Signaling is an important, though often overlooked, component of escalation management, and it will contribute to avoiding misperceptions.\nAs a conflict escalates, stakes mount beyond the initial interests-and as pain is suffered, the potential political aims increase.

He stated that \"foreign interference in support of one side of a domestic conflict and the use of power in this interference gave developments a negative aura\" (Putin 2012c) . Thereafter, he emphasized the information sphere in the Arab Spring revolts in which \"the Internet, social networks, cell phones etc. have turned into an effective tool for the promotion of domestic and international policy on a par with television\" (Putin 2012c ). Putin saw the concept of soft power as \"tools and methods to reach foreign policy goals without the use of arms but by exerting information and other levers of influence\" (Putin 2012c) .

He held that there have always been orators, agitators, and preachers as tools of war but that the advent of global communications has vastly increased the potential to impact the minds of others (Burenok 2014) . This, Burenok argued, had developed in Yugoslavia, where the goal of the information war was to affect the consciousness of the people and justify the actions taken. In North Africa, such methods had been used to degrade the state and in Libya specifically to promote civil war. Last, he saw that the refinement of information warfare continued with Ukraine, where \"the aim [was] regime change by the changing of mass consciousness\" (Burenok 2014 ). Burenok's argument is noteworthy both because of its merits and because he argued more straightforwardly than others that these changes indeed represented a change in the essence of war. Other theorists that have seen information warfare as equally important have often not argued for a change in the nature, or essence, of war.\nIn 2014, the military theorists Valery Konyzhev and Aleksandr Sergunin published a book titled Sovremennaya voyennaya strategiya (Modern military strategy), in which they analyzed the state of Russian military theory.

On this topic, Slipchenko also mentioned the massive global psychological offensive waged by the United States after 9\/11 to support its war aims (Slipchenko 2005, 45) . This arguably implied the building of international support and UN approval for the subsequent operations in Afghanistan.\nSlipchenko anticipated radical change in the conduct of war.

He continued to state that the concept was explicitly in opposition to the phenomenon of the \"Orange Revolution\" (RIA Novosti 2006). For Markov, the Orange Revolution had been intended to subordinate Ukraine to Western forces. Likewise, Deputy Foreign Minister Grigory Karasin stated that Russia could not agree to a violent \"democratization\" of the post-Soviet space (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2006): \"'Color revolutions' or information and political pressure on the current government . . . inevitably leads to destabilization of the situation in the region, with serious long-term complications with unpredictable consequences, including in terms of the growth of extremism\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2006).

Moreover, to judge the innovation by the yardstick of Russian strategic culture, these qualities represent continuity rather than change. The discussion below demonstrates that the peculiarities of the Russian approach that Western experts sometimes present as novelties actually reflect the Russian strategic mentality and military tradition. Thus, the Western puzzlement perhaps stemmed from a lack of expertise in Russian military thought and strategic culture, rather than from any groundbreaking innovation or scarcity of data about it.\nWestern experts often cite the emphasis on indirect-asymmetrical actions across military and non-military domains as the hallmark of Russian innovation. However, this is an overstatement. The Russian quest for asymmetry is not fundamentally novel. Informed, to a certain degree, by the Western debate, 55 'asymmetry' and 'indirect approach' have deep, idiosyncratic roots in Russian military tradition.

It held a traditional view on the military threats that faced the Russian Federation, including existing and potential hotbeds of local wars and armed conflict close to Russia's borders, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, and the threat from international terrorism (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 1993).\nThe National Security Concept differed from the Military Doctrine in some ways. It started by noting that the danger of direct aggression against the Russian Federation was virtually absent due to the strengthening of international law (President of the Russian Federation 1997, points I, III). The main military threat was seen to be local wars on Russia's borders, followed by threats of an internal nature (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III). It stipulated that Russia had an opportunity to solve internal problems, such as terrorism, the economy, and ethnonational struggles (President of the Russian Federation 1997, point III). Thus, military means were seen to be decreasing in their importance relative to other means. The focus on terrorism and ethnonational struggles also had an understandable explanation. The doctrine was published just after the cease-fire of the First Chechen War in 1996, when Russia was left de facto without control of its territory and the Chechen side morphed from nationalist separatism toward jihadism and terrorism (Hughes 2008) .

For Lavrov, this strategy consisted of \"using financial and economic pressure, information attacks, using others on the perimeter of a corresponding state as proxies and of course information and ideological pressure through externally financed non-governmental organisations\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014). This strategy was, for Lavrov, also used directly against Russia. He stated that by \"the use of coercive measures the West unequivocally demonstrates that it does not merely change Russian policy (which in itself is illusory), but it seeks to change the regime\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2014).\nAnother example of stated Russian threat perception can be taken from the leak from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca known as the Panama Papers. The papers displayed a myriad of shell companies and proxies together worth around $2 billion that belonged to key actors around Putin. In a press conference, Putin stated that this was the work of US officials and agencies that sought to destabilize Russia (Putin 2016) .

Messner was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later fought for the Whites during the civil war (Domnin 2005, 22-23) . He was a staunch anticommunist, and his works were prohibited in the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, his thoughts were revived in Russian military thought in the 1990s and 2000s and are particularly evocative of many modern views of war in the Russian military debate (see Fridman 2018, 70-73) . The revival of Messner's thought was due to his focus on the psychological dimension of war, the erosion of values and societal cohesion, the creation of revolts, and the blurring of the boundaries of war and peace, all of which regained popularity in the 2010s.\nMessner joined the army and 1910 and rose to the rank of staff captain during the First World War.

Second, the terminological discrepancy has perceptual underpinnings. Western experts often dub the current Russian approach 'hybrid warfare' (HW), implying that Moscow incorporates nonmilitary, information, cyber, and nuclear, conventional and sub-conventional tools of influence in an orchestrated campaign. Russian experts, however, never utilise this term to describe their own approach. Ironically, they envision their concept of 'NGW', which somewhat resonates with the concept of cross-domain deterrence,4 as a response to what they see as a Western 'hybrid campaign' against Russia.\nSeveral scholars are aware of these inconsistencies. The most advanced effort, so far, to calibrate this terminological disorder has been by using the term 'strategic deterrence'. 5 As Kristine Ven Bruusgaard correctly indicates, Russian and Western sources sometimes use this term to refer to a comprehensive deterrence concept that is broader than the nuclear realm and aimed at shaping a conflict. 6 Although the term did appear recently in the Russian military dictionary, the Russian discourse seldom utilises it. For this and the following reasons, this article does not use the term 'strategic deterrence' and instead introduces the term 'cross-domain coercion' to refer to the phenomenon under scrutiny.

Rather, Baluyevsky saw that a \"state may suffer a 'defeat' without waging warfare\" (Baluyevsky 2007, 19) . For this reason, the chief of the General Staff argued that above military methods and the fighting of wars, the Military Doctrine needed to provide guidance for achieving military security by way of \"preventive diplomacy, international legal, information, economic and other non-military methods\" (Baluyevsky 2007, 19) .\nA more traditional understanding of armed conflict was proposed by the chief of the Strategy Department at the General Staff Academy, Maj.

This statement came in the context of the color revolutions in Georgia and Ukraine, which carried over to some protest movements in Russia.

It utilises the US and NATO methods of warfare to exemplify the changing character of war, projects these moves onto Russia and discusses how to react. Thus, the NGW discussion is equally about the nature of modern warfare, the Western threats and countermeasures. According to the Russian CGS and the 2014 Military Doctrine, the essence of NGW is an amalgamation of hard and non-kinetic tools across various domains through skilful application of coordinated military, diplomatic and economic tools.

This referred to a type of war conducted over long distances, mainly fought with long-range precision-guided missiles, without soldiers coming into direct contact with each other. Slipchenko criticized the analyses that treated innovations in weapon systems as a revolution-for example, those who saw a new tank, the Kalashnikov rifle, or satellites as revolutionary (Slipchenko 2005, 15) . Rather, for him, there had been only six real generations of warfare.\nThe 1991 Gulf War was seen by Slipchenko as a prototype of sixthgeneration warfare. That is to say, it could not fully be classified as a war of the sixth generation, but it displayed many of the characteristics of distance and noncontact warfare. Iraqi forces were numerically superior to the American forces, but they were in the fourth generation of warfare, just like Russia's, and were easily defeated with superior C 4 ISR and precision-guided missiles and a small land force (Slipchenko 2005, 20) .

Surkov connected the threat from orange technologies, by which he meant \"eroding values, declaring the state ineffective, and provoking internal conflicts\" with \"soft capture\" (Surkov 2006) . Soft capture could be seen as a reference to \"soft power, \" a term launched by Joseph Nye and that had become a prominent concept in the US foreign policy community to describe how the United States should conduct foreign policy based on attraction rather than coercion. Surkov warned that orange technologies were \"a very real threat to sovereignty, \" and since they had been utilized in four countries (arguably Serbia, Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan), why not in a fifth (arguably Russia) (Surkov 2006) ?\nThe concept of sovereign democracy was reiterated by Sergei Markov, then a member of the Civic Chamber and later a Duma deputy and a doverennoye litso (envoy) of President Putin. Markov saw sovereign democracy as a way to emphasize the development of the Russian political system toward democracy and away from subordination to external forces such as the United States and EU.

There was indeed agreement on the centrality of information warfare, although in different aspects. Giles argued that Western decision-makers \"cannot afford to underestimate the extent to which Russian concepts and approaches in information activities differ from what they may take for granted\": above, an overt state of conflict with Russia need not necessarily exist in order for Russian capabilities to be deployed. But this also means that in information space, as elsewhere, activities by NATO nations which appear to them to be entirely innocent and unprovocative can be assessed from Moscow as immediately hostile, and provoke a reaction which once again takes NATO by surprise. (Giles 2016b, 76) In this way, Giles suggested, the Russian understanding of war is not strictly defined by armed violence, and information warfare has expanded the understanding.

In terms of conventional war, they saw that weapons based on new technological principles (focusing on what Slipchenko called the reconnaissance-strike systems) would have overwhelming superiority and that this could take over the functions that nuclear weapons have (Chekinov and Bogdanov 2015, 96) . Thus, they insisted on the traditional definition of war, while simultaneously seeing that information warfare is a new type of warfare that lays the groundwork for victory.\nAnother theorist using the concept of hybrid war is Andrew Korybko, a member of the expert council at RISS (Russian Institute for Strategic Studies) and a host at Sputnik News.

As he himself pointed out, the concept was not used until it regained popularity in the West after 2014. Furthermore, when used in the Russian debate by key figures, it is more a passing reference rather than a central concept or tradition of thought. Fridman overemphasizes the importance of gibridnaya voina as a concept used in Russian military thought and neglects other concepts, such as color revolutions, controlled chaos, and simply nonmilitary means, that have long been (and remain) central in the Russian debate (see chapter 2).

On the other hand, a critical examination of Moscow's efforts to deter and compel may take theoretical-conceptual issue with several of its aspects that seem destabilising. The findings suggest that these risks undermining strategic stability seem to emanate from the conceptual challenges that Russian strategists have not yet elaborated on, or overlooked in the nuclear, conventional and informational (cyber) realms. Three challenges loom large.\nThe first challenge relates to coercive signalling. Deterrence failures may result from an actor's inability to signal its capability, resolve and expectations. The literature distinguishes between a 'situation of deterrence', when an actor is deterred without any message being sent, and a 'strategy of deterrence', when a deliberately crafted signal is sent. 68 In the latter case, one should not take it for granted that the deterrence signals sent to an opponent are automatically absorbed and understood. Evaluation of the signal's internalisation is crucial for avoiding threat miscommunication, the opponent's misperception and deterrence failures. How is it possible to ensure that the actors involved in, or observing, the interaction rationalise their moves correctly? How does one communicate red lines and inflict damage without escalating to a major war? Moscow repeatedly expresses genuine frustration that the West attributes to it non-existent strategic intentions in the Baltics, in Ukraine and in Syria.

The first wave focused on nuclear deterrence, the second scrutinised conventional deterrence and the third explored informational (cyber) deterrence. Eventually, three waves merged into the current cross-domain coercion vision. Chronologically, this evolution had two periods. The first period, from 1991 till the 2010, emphasised nuclear weapons in deterring conventional aggressionthe first wave of theory. The second period, from 2010 onward, harmonised the nuclear tool, without diminishing its role, with other tools of coercion, specifically within the non-nuclear and informational (cyber) domains. The last two theory waves developed knowledge precisely for this task, gathering momentum within the intellectual climate shaped by the notion of 'New Generation Warfare' (NGW) and against the backdrop of conventional military reform.\nThe relatively extensive body of research on the subject is not without caveats.

At the age of ninety-five (in 2019), he is still contributing to the military debate in Russia, and his voice remains influential. Throughout his life, Gareyev adhered to a view of war and defense strongly influenced by Soviet military thought (Bukkvoll 2011, 685 ).\nGareyev's view of war can be seen in the quote above from one of his major works, If War Comes Tomorrow? The Contours of Future Armed Conflict. It agrees with the tendency among some late Soviet theorists, discussed in the previous chapter, to shift away from defining war solely as an armed struggle. He argued that armed struggle is \"a part of war-war being a complex social and political phenomenon embracing all spheres of life in the nations engaged, with diverse ways of fighting the enemy

Thus, they contended that it was not the form of violence that differentiated war from other activities but rather the intensity, length, and victory or defeat (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) . They even argued, drawing upon Sun Tzu, that military operations did not need to play a role in war: \"Violence in war does not necessarily imply the use of all known forms of armed might. A war may be won, and the end goals and desired results achieved (in the best-case scenario), without conducting military operations, an opportunity whose realization has 'grown immeasurably' from recent technological innovation\" (Gorbunov and Bogdanov 2009, 21) .\nThis statement is noteworthy because it sees violence in war as something broader than armed violence. The authors also invoked Clausewitz's point that achieving one's goal in war is accomplished by destroying the enemy or depriving him of his power or will to resist. The latter can be done by nonmilitary forms, and it is worth quoting at length how the authors understood them.

This is indeed a new development in Russian military thinking\" (Bartles 2016b, 4) . This reasoning emphasized the notion that beyond nonmilitary means always being important, they are now placed at the center of the military's understanding of, and priorities in, contemporary war. Out of these, Bartles identified information means and NGOs (Bartles 2016b, 4) .\nSimilarly, Jakob Hedenskog, Gudrun Persson, and Carolina Vendil Pallin saw three distinct drivers of Russian threat perception: color revolutions, the \"besieged fortress\" perception, and the struggle over values (Hedenskog, Persson, and Vendil Pallin 2016, 97) . The fear of popular uprisings was \"central for the understanding of the Russian view of modern conflicts\" (Hedenskog, Persson, and Vendil Pallin 2016, 110) . They concluded that the Russian leadership sees color revolutions as a form of aggression from the West against Russia and that \"non-military means are given a fundamental role in contemporary and

While maintaining Khrushchev's notion of war as avoidable, The Soviet Military Encyclopedia noted that it did not \"signify the complete elimination of the possibility of war in the modern age. The nature of imperialism has not changed\" (Grechko and Ogarkov 1993, 368) .\nThis underlies the Soviet view that the character of war depended on two things: economy and technology. Since the cause of war was economic in the Marxist-Leninist view and wars were caused by the ruling class to further their economic interests, the character of war depended on the economy. This was an idea originally proposed by Engels but maintained in Soviet thought (Peralta 2005, 96) . The Soviet Military Encyclopedia saw that the class relations defined the type of war, and they changed over time. The different eras included wars in a slaveholding society, in which the goal was to capture slaves; wars in a feudal society, where the goal was to seize land; wars in a capitalist society to acquire labor and access markets; and imperialist war, which \"exacerbates all of the contradictions of capitalism to extremes and to an enormous degree intensifies the scale, the intensity, and the sphere of

One unofficial military dictionary defines it as:\nA prospective type of strategic actions of armed forces using strategic strike capabilities with conventional warheads, as well as a strictly limited number of strategic nuclear strikes to inflict unacceptable damage on the aggressor and deter him from dangerous actions.

He contended that world wars and large-scale aggressions against Russia were becoming increasingly unlikely, both due to the existence of nuclear weapons and the growing utility of new forms of achieving political and strategic objectives (Gareyev 2005a ). Due to the unlikelihood of large-scale wars, he held that \"other ways of achieving political objectives have been devised: economic sanctions, diplomatic pressure, and information warfare. One country after another can be bent into submission using subversive means from within\" (Gareyev 2005c, 66) . The effectiveness of these means could have been seen in Serbia in the 1990s and in Georgia's Rose Revolution, Gareyev added (Gareyev 2005a) .

One of its main characteristics has been systemic incoherence. What political declarations, strategic-and operational-level commanders' views, statements by defence and nuclear industry officials and data from military exercises all revealed that Russian thinking on the role of nuclear weapons for deterring and de-escalating regional conventional aggression remained an unelaborated concept, far from a doctrine. Senior officials' statements, national level documents, manuals, professional articles, exercises, and industry modernization programs attributed different missions to this arsenal. Theoretical postulates were unsupported by actual assets, several capabilities existed in a conceptual vacuum, and industry initiatives were disconnected from official policy. 9 Scholars mentioned two factors to explain why the set of Russian ideas has been 'detached from the arsenal that should supposedly support it, making it a vague notion, not calibrated across the strategic community and at the various levels of command'. 10 First, although the Soviet experts explored the mutual assured destruction (MAD)-based mutual deterrence in their works, the broad and elaborated Western theory of deterrence was a novelty for Russian strategic studies when","chunk_id":"5acd5cef8f86988b25ee5ea4db51d835","document_ids":["e58624340a4255aebb40fffbc57cca96"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"MUTUAL ASSURED DESTRUCTION (MAD)\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"MAD refers to a doctrine of military strategy and national security policy in which a full-scale use of nuclear weapons by two or more opposing sides would cause the complete annihilation of both the attacker and the defender.\"","source_id":"5acd5cef8f86988b25ee5ea4db51d835"},{"name":"\"DETERRENCE\"","type":"\"CONCEPT\"","description":"\"Deterrence is a military strategy that aims to prevent an attack by making it too costly for the aggressor.

Sometimes referred to in the West as the 'Gerasimov Doctrine' after the Chief of the GS (CGS), this corpus of ideas, circulating in the Russian strategic community, shapes its military theory and practice. Based, among other things, on the lessons learned from the US Defense Transformation and recent conflicts worldwide, this is the latest Russian attempt to conceptualise the current nature of warfare.

The term crossdomain coercion is probably the best description of the Russian art of orchestrating non-nuclear, informational and nuclear influence within a unified programme, which sometimes features in Russian writing as 'strategic deterrence'. The mechanism of this approach that has manifested itself during the recent Russian gambits seems rather straightforward. Informational struggle choreographs all threats across conventional and nuclear, military and non-military domains to produce the most optimal correlation of forces. It is the 'master of ceremonies' of coercion: by exaggerating nuclear and conventional manipulations and muscle flexing, it constructs a cordon sanitaire that affords immune manoeuvring space, a sphere of the possible, within which other forms of influence can achieve tangible results with or preferably without the use of force. Ideally, the image of unacceptable consequences produced by this crossdomain coercion should paralyse the adversary's assertiveness and responsiveness.\nUninterrupted informational deterrence waged on all possible fronts against all possible audiences, augmented by nuclear signalling and supplemented by intra-war coercion, constitutes an integrated cross-domain operation. The main rationale of this operation is to dissuade the adversary from aggression or to deescalate it and impose Russia's will with minimal violence.

As the cost of such can be vast, grasping Russia's understanding of war is thus crucial for international and regional security and is something this book seeks to provide.\nHas the Russian understanding of the nature of war changed? Answering this question is the primary goal of this book. Other studies have analyzed the Russian military thought but not directly engaged in whether or not the nature of war is changing. In answering this question, I will map the development of Russian military thought from the creation of the Soviet Union until today.\nThis book relies on a distinction between the nature of war and the character of war. This was a distinction originally proposed by the general and philosopher Carl von Clausewitz in On War, but it was brought into Soviet military theory by Vladimir Lenin (see chapter 1) and has persisted since then in Russian military thought (see chapter 2). The distinction of character versus nature of war is critical because a change in character is constant as technology and societies change, whereas Clausewitz and others have seen that the nature of war is unchanging.

From the outset, the Gulf War shocked Russian theorists and showed how numerically inferior, but technologically superior, US troops easily beat the Iraqi army, which relied on Soviet mat\u00e9riel and doctrines. Thereafter, the Chechen wars posed critical problems for the Russian Armed Forces, which were both deteriorating and unprepared to fight an insurgency. In 1998, an economic crisis hit Russia, and military expenditure reached a low point. The relative neglect of the armed forces continued up until the Russo-Georgian War of 2008, after which the reform of the armed forces was launched, and they once again became a key priority and an important instrument in Russia's pursuit of power (e.g., see Vendil Pallin and Westerlund 2009).\nIn the war in Ukraine, a decidedly more competent Russian Armed Forces, together with Russia's intelligence agencies, swiftly captured the Crimean Peninsula without large-scale resistance and created and directed an insurgency in Eastern Ukraine. Moreover, Russia managed to achieve a high degree of coordination between its military means and its nonmilitary means and most notably the information arena.

Its addition to the traditional domains 54 is a second novelty. Informational strike epitomises the logic Gerasimov's doctrine being a strategy of breaking up the internal coherence of the enemy system, not about annihilating it. Against the backdrop of miniaturisation of hard power to the necessary minimum, when perception turns into the centre of gravity, informational struggle becomes one of the main tools for achieving the goals of cross-domain coercion.\nIn recent conflicts, Moscow demonstrated an aptitude for learning, transformation and scale of improvisation that are rather unorthodox for post-Soviet Russian military.

Although such a diagnosis is in the main accurate, these characteristics are not particularly novel for the Russian approach.

One effect of the revolution in science and technology, according to Serebryannikov, was that information and ideological technologies enabled the altering of the mentality and psychology of nations (Serebryannikov 2004, 178) .

However, the definition does not explicitly dismiss the role of nonmilitary means, as the discussions in the 1960s did. Military theorists B. K. Kanevsky and P. N. Shabardin argued that war was not solely an armed confrontation but rather included nonmilitary means such as economic, diplomatic, intelligence, technological, and ideological to support armed conflict (Kanevsky and Shabardin 1987, 121) . While they included nonmilitary means in their concept of war, it is unclear if they thought that a confrontation with all means short of military could amount to war. In any case, the notion that war could be something more than strict violence had started to gain ascendance and now featured in the debates surrounding the nature of war. Meanwhile, formal definitions had a clear view of armed violence as the defining factor.\nIn both the Marxist-Leninist and Clausewitzian definitions, war is understood as an instrument of politics and specifically class politics in Marxist-Leninism. This is not an uncommon way to see war, but it could differ somewhat from the Western understanding. In the Soviet view, the underlying policy of a government remained, while it used peace or war as instruments to further its policy depending on circumstance (Vigor 1975, 8) .

By now, it was clear that the Russian leaders saw Western governments as responsible for color revolutions.\nAfter the parliamentary elections on December 4, 2011, reports of election fraud led to street protests. The protests escalated and continued until the spring of 2012. The protesters came to rely on online mobilization, given the control and censorship of traditional media in Russia (White and McAllister 2014, 79) . When asked in the end-of-the-year press conference in 2011 if the protesters' white ribbon was a symbol of a color revolution in Russia, Putin responded that \"everything is clear. This is a proven scheme of destabilization of society. I do not think that this scheme was born by itself \" (Putin 2011) .

However, few Western studies have engaged in depth with how the Russian understanding is changing. Rather, it seems that the debate on how war is changing assumes that war in general is changing and that it is the same (and perceived as the same) for all states. A key insight from the field of strategic culture points out that communities with different cultures and values can look at the same thing but interpret it very differently. As put by Colin Gray, \"Culture yields us the truths, small and large, that we know should guide our decisions and actions\" (Gray 2007, 8) . Likewise, \"strategists and their institutions cannot be acultural and hence will continuously perceive and interpret the material realm culturally\" (Poore 2003, 282) . Culture should be seen as a context from which an understanding cannot be isolated. This has been put particularly in the case of Russia as the Russian paradigm is \"idiosyncratic, reflect[s] a strong cultural imprint, and need [s] to be analysed in the context of [its] strategic culture\" (Adams","chunk_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31","document_ids":["ec2597b1a8f8024f0a5462a1fc130dc2"],"n_tokens":300,"entities":[{"name":"\"GALEOTTI\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Galeotti is a member of the organization that published works on how war is changing.\"\n\"Galeotti is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31","entity_type":"\"ORGANIZATION\""},{"name":"\"GILES\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Giles is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"RENZ\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Renz is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"CHARAP\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Charap is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"THOMAS\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Thomas is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"BARTLES\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Bartles is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"FREEDMAN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Freedman is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"KOFMAN\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Kofman is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"},{"name":"\"ROJANSKY\"","type":"\"PERSON\"","description":"\"Rojansky is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"","source_id":"597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31"}],"entity_graph":"<graphml xmlns=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\" xmlns:xsi=\"http:\/\/www.w3.org\/2001\/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns http:\/\/graphml.graphdrawing.org\/xmlns\/1.0\/graphml.xsd\">  <key id=\"d3\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"entity_type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d2\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"source_id\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d1\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"description\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <key id=\"d0\" for=\"node\" attr.name=\"type\" attr.type=\"string\" \/>  <graph edgedefault=\"undirected\">    <node id=\"&quot;GALEOTTI&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Galeotti is a member of the organization that published works on how war is changing.\"\"Galeotti is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>      <data key=\"d3\">\"ORGANIZATION\"<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;GILES&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Giles is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;RENZ&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Renz is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;CHARAP&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Charap is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;THOMAS&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Thomas is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;BARTLES&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Bartles is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;FREEDMAN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Freedman is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;KOFMAN&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Kofman is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>    <node id=\"&quot;ROJANSKY&quot;\">      <data key=\"d0\">\"PERSON\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d1\">\"Rojansky is an author who wrote about how war is changing.\"<\/data>      <data key=\"d2\">597b96f29d47f44fa260f97ed43bcb31<\/data>    <\/node>  <\/graph><\/graphml>"}

'Informational pressure' on the adversary, its armed forces, state apparatus, citizens and world public opinion also produces favourable conditions for other forms of coercion. 50 Because there is no clear division of labour in the sphere of informational struggle, multiple organisations competing for resources and responsibilities within the Russian strategic community promote theory development. In the main, this discussion tends to blur any distinction between the electronic and cyber forms of informational struggle, up to their full convergence. 51 This, in turn, stimulates exploration of the digital-technological aspects of informational deterrence. Avenues of future research on the 'dialectics of deterrence' in the cyber realm, which GS experts designated in 2016, exemplify several conceptualpractical deficits in this realm. The experts call for evaluation of unacceptable damage that deters the opponent and targets selection criteria; the joint employment of cyber and conventional capabilities to optimise coercion; the formulation of an 'adequate understanding' among the adversary's decision makers of the resolve to use cyber capabilities and their effectiveness. 52 \nHow do these three forms of influence relate to each other?

His main focus was not on the threat of color revolutions, although he criticized foreign governments' support of democracy movements as an abuse of the concept of democracy. Rather, he criticized the United States and an uncontained \"hyper use of force\" in international relations (Putin 2007a) . He discussed foreign governments' support for NGOs in the questionsand-answers section, outlining that \"when these non-governmental organizations are financed by foreign governments, we see them as an instrument that foreign states use to carry out their Russian policies\" (Putin 2007a ). Putin concluded that the financing from foreign governments in the name of democracy was \"simply one state exerting influence on another\" (Putin 2007a ). Thus, he underlined the view of democracy promotion as a cover for foreign countries to pursue their interests, using NGOs as the means to that end.\nIn another interview, Putin added election monitors to the threat and asserted that Russia was a target.

Nonetheless, many of the key notions that were later incorporated into mainstream military theory first appeared then, such as the blurring boundary between war and peace, nonmilitary means being violent, information being a weapon, and nonmilitary means being more effective than military means and sufficient in and of themselves to achieve strategic outcomes. This underlines the long-term evolution of Russian military thought, often overlooked in the Western debate. The discussion has run in parallel with a discussion of how conventional military means are seen to change, which has focused on the increasing utility of high-precision, longrange weapons, depending mostly on Slipchenko's work.\nEven though the then defense minister Ivanov stated in 2005 that Russia was in an undeclared war, it took until after the Arab Spring and the protests in the Russian elections of 2011-12 for the idea to gain ascendancy in Russia that the concept of war needed to be broadened. Thereafter, the majority of the authoritative actors in Russian national security and military theory started seeing that nonmilitary measures were so effective that they were affecting the understanding of war. This shift was also reflected, although less explicitly, in the public security doctrines. The broadening of an understanding of war is due to the increased importance of nonmilitary means and especially information warfare and the threat from color revolutions.\nThe most

For Sergeyev, this was because up until the Serbian campaign, large-scale ground troops had been needed. The main driver for this revolution was seen to be the informatization of warfare and the use of highprecision weapons. He further argued that the \"main feature of the new stage of the revolution in military affairs is a sharp increase of the traditional weapons and the emergence of new types of conventional weapons\" (Sergeyev 1999, italics added) . This statement is particularly noteworthy because even if he perceived that a revolution in military affairs was ongoing, it was confined to traditional weapons or new conventional weapons.

This will be investigated in the next chapter.\nChAPTer 4\nIt was this fear of \"regime change\" and a \"color revolution\" that prompted the Putin regime to go to war [in Ukraine].\n-Heidi Reisinger and Aleksandr Golts (2015, 114) T he threat of revolutions has long been present in the minds of Russian leaders, but it took until the early 2010s for them to take center stage in terms of the threat perception and understanding of war among Russian elites and military theorists. This shift started with a series of nonviolent uprisings in the former Soviet Union from 2003 to 2005 known as the color revolutions. 1 In Georgia, Ukraine, and Kyrgyzstan, the opposition succeeded with nonviolent protest tactics, the training for which was often financially supported by Western organizations and\/or governments (Mitchell 2012; Spoerri 2008, 81; Beach\u00e1in and Polese 2010, 37; Beissinger 2007, 261) .

The distinction of character versus nature of war is critical because a change in character is constant as technology and societies change, whereas Clausewitz and others have seen that the nature of war is unchanging. As explained by the Russian theorist Pavel Kazarin, the nature of war refers to the properties or traits that war has, and the character refers to the content (Kazarin 2002, 18) . Thus, a change in the nature of war would represent a break from past understandings of what war is, impacting the full knowledge system surrounding war.\nIn a study of the nature of war in the Soviet Union, the Polish scholar Julian Lider saw that \"the nature or essence of war encompasses those general features which distinguish war as a political act and armed struggle from other socio-political and socio-historical phenomena\" (Lider 1977, 245) . This captures very well how Lenin defined war as the continuation of politics with violent means (Lenin 1915, 219) . The key characteristic of the nature of war was thus armed violence applied to a political purpose.

Marxist philosophy and dialectics had their roots in Hegelian dialectics, even if the Marxist tradition developed in opposition to it, especially with regard to the central role of the state for Hegel (Gat 1992, 372) . This philosophical kinship, which included the common focus on historicism, was a key reason why communist military theorists found such affinity with Clausewitz, who was also drawing heavily on Hegel (Gat 1992, 364) . Lenin appreciatively noted Clausewitz's use of dialectics.\nA third component that made Soviet military science scientific was its focus on history. Historical analysis was a constituent part of Marxist-Leninist dialectical materialism and seen as critical in the development of Soviet, and later Russian, military theory.

That is, perceived stability at higher thresholds of conflict may result in instability at lower levels because of the perceived ability, by at least one party, that it can manage escalation.\nBy developing an interlinked series of approaches that range from intimidation to inflicting calibrated damage for the purpose of escalation management, the Russian military has not traded warfighting for intra-war deterrence. The means involved, and the operational concepts for their employment, afford a suitable hedge strategy to be used in theater warfighting with precision conventional or nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Therefore, there is both a general purpose force for warfighting, and the ability to employ a pre-designated strategic deterrence force to deliver deterrent damage. These capabilities are equally applicable in peacetime, during which they perform demonstrative actions intended to contain the United States and induce restraint in Russian adversaries.\nThe US lags in developing such concepts; it focuses on warfighting capabilities while a tremendous cognitive gap remains on the question of escalation management and war termination. The absence of a theory of escalation management or approaches that could affect war termination, remains a significant deficit in strategy for great power war.

Nonetheless, it is too optimistic to solve a difference in strategic culture by semantic construct.

Color revolutions have grown from being seen as mostly spontaneous uprisings (albeit with foreign support) to a form of warfare orchestrated by the West. After 2014, color revolutions were understood as the West's main geopolitical tool to achieve its political objectives and as a form of warfare (Gerasimov 2014a) . There is agreement among elites and military theorists that the color revolutions were nonviolent events, even though some of the latter events that came to be included in the concept, such as the Arab Spring and the Euromaidan revolt, have included violence. Nonetheless, some Russian theorists objected to the description of the color revolutions as nonviolent because they saw that they were ultimately backed up by violence or the threat thereof. The Western military interventions in Libya and Syria are seen as conceptually separate from the nonviolent color revolutions that were in those cases pretexts for armed interventions. This book shows that the threat of color revolutions increased notably on the political agenda in the period 2004-6, but it took until 2012-14 for them to become mainstream among Russian military theorists.\nThe broadening of the Russian understanding of war has been a long-term evolutionary process. This is to be seen in contrast to reoccurring calls for a revolution in Russian military thought and practice, often heard after the invasion of Ukraine or the interference in the US

The GS identified the creation of such a unified system, based on complex measures of both a military and nonmilitary nature, as the most important task. 32 During the years leading up to publication of the 2014 doctrine, a leap forward towards 'non-nuclear deterrence' became evident. Annual exercises since 2011 demonstrated the growing role assigned to advanced conventional munitions relative to the previous decade, when the nuclear arsenal was pivotal in the theatre of operations. Believing that non-nuclear means (precision weapons, ballistic and cruise missiles) and informational (cyber) capabilities generate battlefield and deterrence effects compatible with nuclear weapons, Russian experts, more than before, emphasised deterrence as a function of non-nuclear, hard and soft instruments. 33 Leading up to the events in Ukraine, an assumption emerged in the Russian strategic community that the relevance of nuclear deterrence is limited to a very narrow set of scenarios, unless it is skilfully synthesised with other forms of coercion. The 2014 doctrine manifests this assumption by emphasising non-nuclear forceful deterrence based on military, political, diplomatic, technical and economic means, with informational struggle as its main component. 34 The 2014 doctrine codified ideas circulating in the Russian expert community.

The interesting detail is that this definition both affirms the centrality of armed struggle (vooruzhennaya borba) and the recognition that economic, political, ideological, and other means are part of war. Both definitions agree with Gareyev, placing armed struggle at the center of war, while recognizing the importance of other, nonmilitary means.\nIn 2002, Vladislav Orlyansky, a professor at the Military Academy of the General Staff, wrote a study on the relations of the concept of armed struggle and information struggle. He had noted confusion in the military debate, given the increasing popularity of the concept of information struggle. For him, armed struggle was \"the main type of confrontation in wars, \" and he saw that \"armed conflict is the use of military means\" (Orlyansky 2002, 42) .

The authors unfortunately did not attempt to gauge the relative prominence of the various competing strands, but they objected to the theoretical value of wars of consciousness. Nonetheless, this strand cannot be discarded, because the ideas of an ongoing war of values, and perhaps civilization, does appear in public doctrines. In terms of the findings of this chapter, it seems that wars of consciousness and subversion-wars are the schools of thought that have gained most traction in recent years. Furthermore, both of these schools draw on the teachings of Messner and are part of his influence in Russian military thought.\nIn 2015, Lt. Gen.

This book will also focus on theorists involved in drafting the public security doctrines and with influential positions in the military-theoretical debates and the General Staff.\nTo be clear, there is no such thing as a single understanding of war, either in Russia or elsewhere. It is an aggregate of different views that can be more or less conforming. Nonetheless, analyzing the understandings of war in these three different areas allows for the approximation of an understanding of war and how it has developed. The key rationale for adopting such an approach is that other major studies in the field (most notably Bukkvoll 2011; Thomas 2016b; Fridman 2018) mostly track the thoughts of individual theorists without a weighted assessment of how representative their thoughts might be of the general consensus. Given the difficulty of establishing a single understanding of war, the argument for an aggregate view will largely be based on argument and interpretation.

The main rationale of this operation is to dissuade the adversary from aggression or to deescalate it and impose Russia's will with minimal violence. The amalgamation of different tools of cross-domain coercion ensures that the limitations of each form of influence are compensated by other capabilities, in peacetime, in crisis and in wartime. When in a certain scenario, the effectiveness of one type of influence, for example nuclear, diminishes; it is supplemented by other types of coercion that could be employed in a more pressing manner including actual use of force. This ensures flexibility and effectiveness that each tool by itself cannot provide and capitalises on the Russian competitive advantage over the West to operate and shape reality across several domains. 53 \nHow innovative is the Russian cross-domain coercion approach? How does it diverge from previous Russian practice? The main novelty is that in essence, this approach is not a brute force but a coercion strategy.

On the one hand, war was perceived as something evil that could be remedied only by the transformation of the whole world to communism and the concomitant eradication of class societies (Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1919, 116). On the other, war was a positive force that could speed up the revolutionary process, through which all societies would become communist, either through peaceful transformation or armed revolution (Vigor 1975, 17) .

{"id":"31d8ac7fc85d988e67da2c6480208aad","chunk":" seeing war as an armed struggle did not exhaust the concept of war but rather needed to include the other means of influencing the enemy. The definition of war started to shift modestly at the end of the Soviet Union. For instance, the 1986 encyclopedia, as quoted above, defined armed struggle as the main form of war, while mentioning the role of nonmilitary means in war. There seemed to be a paradox in the Soviet understanding of war. On the one hand, war was clearly defined as the continuation of politics by violent means, which implied a clear connection to advancing policy. On the other, the inevitability of war created by the sheer existence of exploitative systems seemed to make war an almost automatic, perhaps irrational occurrence. That said, Marxist theorists were clear that the exploitative class would use war as an instrument of its politics to protect and expand its positions.\nTo conclude, this chapter found an essentially static way of understanding the nature of war among Soviet leaders and military thinkers. The only significant changes were that the notion of the inevitability of war was amended and, among some military thinkers, nonmilitary means were included in war, while armed violence remained the defining feature. Even if propaganda and subversion held an important role in the conduct of conflict, they did not affect the definition of war. This was the military thinking that the newly established Russian Federation inherited, which the next chapter will analyze.\nThe russian Understanding of War after the Dissolution of the Soviet
