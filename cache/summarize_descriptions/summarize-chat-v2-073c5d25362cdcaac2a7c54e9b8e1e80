{"result": "The **Orange Revolution** was a significant pro-democracy movement in Ukraine that took place in 2004, leading to a change in government.  It is considered a historical event that has influenced the passing of new laws and is often referenced as a potential model for color revolutions, both admired and feared by various parties. While some view it as a positive example of popular resistance and Western influence, others, such as Markov, present it as a negative example of foreign interference intended to subordinate Ukraine.  The Orange Revolution's impact extends beyond Ukrainian borders, with its experiences and techniques being shared with Russian youth organizations and even being connected by Putin to the Russian protests. \n\n\n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
