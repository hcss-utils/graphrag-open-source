{"result": "The **EU (European Union)** is a political and economic union of European countries.  It shares NATO's concerns about Russia and has imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation. The EU is also accused by Russia of providing support to Ukraine that led to war, provoking the removal of the legitimate president in Ukraine, and supporting the overthrow of the Ukrainian government and inciting conflict. \n\nDespite these accusations, the EU is portrayed as an organization concerned about Russia's actions and has adopted the concept of hybrid warfare to understand contemporary Russian military tactics.  The EU is criticized by Putin for its double standards in promoting democracy. The EU is mentioned as a potential actor influencing events in Russia, supporting NGOs, and potentially involved in information warfare related to the conflict in Ukraine.  Russia seeks to distance itself from the EU, viewing it as an external force. \n\n\n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
