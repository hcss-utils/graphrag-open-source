{"result": "**STRATEGIC DETERRENCE** is a military doctrine and concept aimed at preventing conflict by threatening massive retaliation if an adversary attacks.  It encompasses a broader scope than nuclear deterrence, aiming to shape conflict through various means, including the use of military force, both conventional and potentially limited nuclear employment. \n\nSome scholars use \"Strategic Deterrence\" to describe a comprehensive approach that integrates different forms of influence beyond just military might, as seen in Russian writings where it refers to their unified strategy for exerting influence on the global stage.  \n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
