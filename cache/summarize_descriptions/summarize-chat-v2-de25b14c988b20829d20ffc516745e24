{"result": "Marx and Engels were influential thinkers whose ideas on capitalism and class struggle significantly influenced Lenin's views on war.  While they were capitalists themselves, Marx and Engels supported the British-French aggression in Crimea during the 1850s, believing it would contribute to the downfall of the czar. They viewed war as a continuation of political struggles between powers and classes, holding a perspective on war that differed from Lenin's. Despite their support for this particular conflict, Marx and Engels are also recognized as predecessors to Lenin's ideas on imperialism and war. \n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
