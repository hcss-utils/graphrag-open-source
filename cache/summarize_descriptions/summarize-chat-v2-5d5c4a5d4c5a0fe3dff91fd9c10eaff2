{"result": "Libya is a country in North Africa that has been cited as an example of a \"color revolution\" escalating into large-scale military action.  \n\nThe country experienced internal instability provoked through subversive actions and \"controlled chaos,\" which was further destabilized by the use of \"soft power\" against the government. Information warfare, specifically targeting Libya, was used to promote civil war.
