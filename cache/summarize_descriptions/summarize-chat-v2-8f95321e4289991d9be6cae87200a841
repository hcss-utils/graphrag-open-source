{"result": "SOKOLOVSKY is a Soviet military theorist who authored influential works such as \"Voyennaya strategiya\" and \"Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii,\" providing authoritative perspectives on war within the Soviet Union.  He emphasizes the principle of complete subordination of military strategy to policy, refuting claims that war had ceased to be an instrument of policy. While SOKOLOVSKY acknowledges that nuclear weapons represent a change in the character of war, he maintains that they do not fundamentally alter its nature, as opposed to those who argue for a complete shift in the definition of war.  SOKOLOVSKY holds a narrower view of war, defining it solely by armed violence. \n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
