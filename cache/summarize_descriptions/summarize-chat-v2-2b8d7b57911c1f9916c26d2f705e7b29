{"result": "The **Red Army** was the military force of the Soviet Union and the army of the Bolsheviks.  They believed the Red Army held a \"master key to military reality\" due to its understanding of dialectical materialism. While it was a significant military force in the past, its threat has diminished. This decline is attributed to fear and lack of initiative among military leaders following purges, which hindered its development.
