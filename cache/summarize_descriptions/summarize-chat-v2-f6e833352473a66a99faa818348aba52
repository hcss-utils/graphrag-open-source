{"result": "## NGW (New Generation Warfare)\n\nNGW (New Generation Warfare) is a Russian military doctrine that emphasizes information warfare as the primary battlefield. It represents a Russian understanding of modern warfare, focusing on orchestrating both military and non-military measures to manipulate an adversary's perception, decision-making, and behavior. This strategy aims to influence an adversary's will and ultimately achieve strategic objectives through informational struggle. \n\nNGW is often discussed alongside the Gerasimov Doctrine and is seen as a response to Western \"hybrid campaigns.\" While initially popular, the concept of Non-Government Warfare (NGW) appears to have faded from Russian military thought.  The Russian National Guard of Warfare is considered a key player in implementing NGW strategies during the invasion and informational warfare campaigns. \n\n\n", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
