It is defined and analyzed from various perspectives, highlighting its complexity and multifaceted nature. \n\nWhile often understood as a conflict involving armed force, as defined by Kvachkov and Gareyev, war encompasses a broader range of activities beyond physical violence. Soviet scholars, as well as other sources, define war as \"\"the continuation of politics by means of armed force,\"\" emphasizing its strategic and political dimensions.  \n\nThe text presents diverse interpretations of war.
