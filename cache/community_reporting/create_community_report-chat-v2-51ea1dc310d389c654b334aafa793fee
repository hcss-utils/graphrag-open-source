He is cited as an authority on the militarization of social life under socialism and emphasized the connection between war and revolution.  Lenin viewed war as a necessary instrument for societal transformation and achieving socialism, arguing that imperialist wars are inevitable under capitalism. \n\nHe built upon the ideas of Marx and Engels, incorporating \"\"violent\"\" into the definition of war and defining it as the continuation of politics by violent means. This perspective, while influential, has been critiqued by scholars like Kirshin.  Lenin incorporated Clausewitz's ideas into Marxist theory, appreciating his use of dialectics and agreeing with his view that politics are superior to strategy. He also supported Svechin's similar stance on the primacy of politics over strategy. \n\nLenin's early writings serve as a foundational starting point for understanding Soviet military thought. His ideology emphasizes that peace is as much a continuation of politics as war, a notion further highlighted in The Soviet Military Encyclopedia.  His definition of war as an instrument of politics heavily influenced Soviet thought throughout history, even as the definition of war expanded to include non-military means. Lenin's writings on war became foundational for understanding warfare in both the Soviet Union and Russia. \n\n\n\",18\n304,\"\"\"IMPERIALISM: THE HIGHEST STAGE OF CAPITALISM\"\"\",,1\n696,\"\"\"MILITARY PROGRAMME OF THE PROLETARIAN REVOLUTION\"\"\",,1\n112,\"\"\"SOVIET\"\"\",\"Soviet refers to the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR), highlighting its historical and geopolitical context.
