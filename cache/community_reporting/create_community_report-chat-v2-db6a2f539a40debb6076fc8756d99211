He is a prominent figure in Russian military theory, known for his concept of the \"\"adaptive approach to warfare\"\" and emphasizing non-military means.  Gerasimov argues that the nature of war has changed, with non-military means becoming as important as traditional military force. He believes the lines between war and peace are blurring due to the effectiveness of these non-military tactics, such as \"\"color revolutions,\"\" which he views as a new form of warfare instigated by the West. \n\nGerasimov's writings and speeches have significantly influenced the understanding of modern warfare, particularly his concept of \"\"hybrid warfare\"\" which combines both military and non-military means. He is considered a key figure in expressing Russia's stance on information warfare and advocates for changes in the laws of war to reflect this evolving landscape.
