It is defined and analyzed from various perspectives, highlighting its complexity and multifaceted nature. \n\nWhile often understood as a conflict involving armed force, as defined by Kvachkov and Gareyev, war encompasses a broader range of activities beyond physical violence. Soviet scholars, as well as other sources, define war as \"\"the continuation of politics by means of armed force,\"\" emphasizing its strategic and political dimensions.  \n\nThe text presents diverse interpretations of war. It is discussed both as an evil to be eradicated and as a necessary tool for achieving communist goals. Additionally, it is presented as an instrument of politics, strategically employed by the Soviets. \n\nAuthors like Malyshev delve into various forms of warfare, including economic, psychological, and information warfare, expanding the traditional understanding of armed conflict.  Gorbunov and Bogdanov argue that the nature of war is constantly evolving, while Kazarin focuses on defining and analyzing its core characteristics. Clausewitz's ideas on achieving victory are discussed within the context of war, further emphasizing its strategic significance. \n\n\nUltimately, \"\"War\"\" refers to armed conflict between nations or groups, but the text delves deeper into its complexities, exploring its political, social, economic, and ideological implications.  \n\",30\n265,\"\"\"MILITARY THEORISTS\"\"\",\"Military theorists are a group of individuals who study and analyze warfare, including its various aspects.

While they were capitalists themselves, Marx and Engels supported the British-French aggression in Crimea during the 1850s, believing it would contribute to the downfall of the czar.

While SOKOLOVSKY acknowledges that nuclear weapons represent a change in the character of war, he maintains that they do not fundamentally alter its nature, as opposed to those who argue for a complete shift in the definition of war.
