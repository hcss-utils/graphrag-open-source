Slipchenko's writings focus on the evolving nature of conventional warfare, particularly emphasizing the increasing importance of high-precision, long-range weapons and reconnaissance-strike systems. He argues that these systems hold overwhelming superiority in modern conflict. \n\nSlipchenko is also a leading proponent of \"\"remote/contactless war,\"\" defining it as warfare conducted through precision strikes and information manipulation, viewing information itself as a destructive weapon. His theories on non-contact warfare and information dominance have been influential in shaping Russian military doctrine.

The U.S. is also accused by Russia of waging a hybrid war against other countries and interfering in Russian elections. \n\nThe U.S. has been involved in supporting regime change through color revolutions, such as the Orange Revolution, and is mentioned as a potential instigator of the Arab Spring. It is also accused of engaging in information warfare, non-contact warfare, and psychological offensives.  \n\nFurthermore, the U.S. is described as a country capable of inflicting significant economic damage on adversaries and a potential target of Russian military strategy.

He also argues that nonmilitary means, such as color revolutions, should be prioritized over traditional military force.
