It serves as a key document that defines Russia's understanding of war and security, encompassing strategic principles and guidelines governing military action.  \n\nFirst established in the Soviet Union, the doctrine has been updated several times, most notably in 2000 and 2010. The 2010 Military Doctrine, for example, defines five concepts of war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and large-scale war. It also outlines the objectives, methods, and characteristics of contemporary military conflicts.  \n\nPrevious iterations of the doctrine held a traditional view on military threats facing Russia, including local wars, weapons proliferation, and terrorism. However, the document is continually being updated in response to perceived threats and evolving geopolitical landscapes. \n\nThe Military Doctrine closely aligns with Russia's Foreign Policy Concept of 1993 and includes references to non-nuclear deterrence as a key aspect of its strategy. Notably, it also acknowledges the potential for protest within the Russian population.  \n\",21\n53,\"\"\"MINISTRY OF DEFENSE\"\"\",\"The MINISTRY OF DEFENSE is a governmental organization responsible for Russia's military affairs.

It published the 2000 Military Doctrine and the 2010 Military Doctrine, as well as a Military Encyclopedic Dictionary defining terms like \"\"myatezhvoina.\"\" The Ministry also provided a definition of war in 2007, emphasizing its characteristics and core content.  \n\nFurthermore, the Ministry defines subversion-wars as armed fighting by insurgent or rebel forces.
