Since 2014, Ukraine has experienced significant unrest and political instability, culminating in a war initiated by Russia. This conflict has been widely described as an example of \"\"hybrid warfare,\"\" which capitalizes on indirect action, informational campaigns, and the use of non-state actors like NGOs and private military companies.\n\nThe events in Ukraine have been interpreted differently by various parties. While some view the Ukrainian situation as a \"\"color revolution\"\" instigated by external forces, others see it as a legitimate struggle for self-determination against Russian aggression.  Russia has accused Ukraine of receiving support from the US and EU, further escalating tensions. \n\nThe conflict in Ukraine has had a profound impact on global discourse. It has brought attention to the work of military theorists like Chekinov and Bogdanov, who have analyzed the evolving nature of warfare. Additionally, Ukraine serves as a testing ground for Russia's military capabilities and a site where its military theories are being applied. \n\nThe ongoing conflict in Ukraine highlights the country's geopolitical significance and its role as a flashpoint between Russia and the West.  \n\",12\n226,\"\"\"EU\"\"\",\"The **EU (European Union)** is a political and economic union of European countries.  It shares NATO's concerns about Russia and has imposed sanctions on the Russian Federation. The EU is also accused by Russia of providing support to Ukraine that led to war, provoking the removal of the legitimate president in Ukraine, and supporting the overthrow of the Ukrainian government and inciting conflict. \n\nDespite these accusations, the EU is portrayed as an organization concerned about Russia's actions and has adopted the concept of hybrid warfare to understand contemporary Russian military tactics.  The EU is criticized by Putin for its double standards in promoting democracy. The EU is mentioned as a potential actor influencing events in Russia, supporting NGOs, and potentially involved in information warfare related to the conflict in Ukraine.  Russia seeks to distance itself from the EU, viewing it as an external force. \n\n\n\",3\n120,\"\"\"US\"\"\",\"The **United States (US)** is portrayed as a dominant force in global affairs, often contrasted with Russia. The US is a member of the West and actively participates in sanctions against Russia.  \n\nRussian sources accuse the US of militarizing the informational domain, provoking the removal of Ukraine's legitimate president, engaging in \"\"political engineering\"\" and interfering in Russian elections, organizing a \"\"color revolution\"\" in Ukraine, and using hybrid warfare tactics to threaten Russia. They also claim the US lags behind Russia in developing escalation management concepts and focuses primarily on warfighting capabilities. \n\nThe US is identified as a key player in potential conflicts with Russia, particularly regarding target selection, and its methods of warfare are used as examples in discussions about the changing character of war and the debate on new generation warfare (NGW).  \n\nFurthermore, the US is mentioned as a potential participant in nuclear conflicts, whose interests might be unclear in certain situations. Russian sources also suggest the US could be an external influence in Russia's social unrest. \n\nDespite these accusations, the US is also presented as a country that should pay attention to Russia's military ideas and as a key actor promoting democracy globally.  The US was involved in an election interference event in 2016 which drew attention to Russian military thought.\n\n\nIt's important to note that these descriptions come from a single source, and may not represent a balanced or complete picture of the US's role in international relations. \n\",3\n375,\"\"\"LEVADA CENTER\"\"\",\"The Levada Center is a Russian polling organization.
