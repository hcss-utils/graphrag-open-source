It serves as a key document that defines Russia's understanding of war and security, encompassing strategic principles and guidelines governing military action.  \n\nFirst established in the Soviet Union, the doctrine has been updated several times, most notably in 2000 and 2010. The 2010 Military Doctrine, for example, defines five concepts of war and conflict: military conflict, armed conflict, local war, regional war, and large-scale war. It also outlines the objectives, methods, and characteristics of contemporary military conflicts.  \n\nPrevious iterations of the doctrine held a traditional view on military threats facing Russia, including local wars, weapons proliferation, and terrorism. However, the document is continually being updated in response to perceived threats and evolving geopolitical landscapes. \n\nThe Military Doctrine closely aligns with Russia's Foreign Policy Concept of 1993 and includes references to non-nuclear deterrence as a key aspect of its strategy. Notably, it also acknowledges the potential for protest within the Russian population.  \n\",21\n586,\"\"\"INFORMATION-PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE\"\"\",\"**INFORMATION-PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE**\n\nInformation-psychological warfare is a novel and powerful form of warfare that aims to alter the consciousness of a country through information manipulation. It seeks to erode trust in institutions and potentially lead to revolutions, as seen in color revolutions. This militarized tactic is presented as a wide-ranging attack against Russia, significantly influencing public opinion and national consciousness. \n\n\n\",3\n58,\"\"\"RUSSIAN FEDERATION\"\"\",\"The Russian Federation, emerging from the dissolution of the Soviet Union,  inherited military thinking from its predecessor. While seeking to establish new security policies, it faces both military and nonmilitary threats according to documents like the Military Doctrine and National Security Concept. The country identifies itself as a target of potential hostilities and destabilization, as outlined by Gareyev.  \n\nThe Russian Federation's military doctrine is subject to analysis and undergoes significant changes in structure and capabilities.  Internal military dangers and long-term information security are also discussed within the context of the nation's evolving security landscape. \n\",13\n53,\"\"\"MINISTRY OF DEFENSE\"\"\",\"The MINISTRY OF DEFENSE is a governmental organization responsible for Russia's military affairs. It defines military doctrine and strategy, outlining the core tasks for the armed forces and issuing military doctrines.  \n\nThe Ministry is considered the source of information about military dangers, capabilities, doctrine, and political goals. It published the 2000 Military Doctrine and the 2010 Military Doctrine, as well as a Military Encyclopedic Dictionary defining terms like \"\"myatezhvoina.\"\" The Ministry also provided a definition of war in 2007, emphasizing its characteristics and core content.  \n\nFurthermore, the Ministry defines subversion-wars as armed fighting by insurgent or rebel forces. Vasily Burenok is a high-ranking official within the Ministry of Defense. \n\",10\n57,\"\"\"NATIONAL SECURITY CONCEPT\"\"\",\"The **National Security Concept** is a document outlining Russia's security strategy.
