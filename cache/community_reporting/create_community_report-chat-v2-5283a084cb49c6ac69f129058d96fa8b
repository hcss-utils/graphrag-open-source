Gerasimov believes that information resources are effective weapons and that the U.S. has instigated \"\"color revolutions\"\" in various regions.

The doctrine emphasizes the importance of information warfare and psychological operations, as well as the impact of informatization and automatization on conventional armed forces. It is often discussed in relation to Non-Government Warfare (NGW) as an alternative name or aspect of the same concept.
