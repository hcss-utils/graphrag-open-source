It involves the strategic utilization of information and communication technologies (ICTs) to influence perceptions, decision-making, and ultimately achieve specific objectives. \n\nWhile primarily considered a non-military tactic, Information Warfare can be employed by both state and non-state actors to destabilize nations, sway public opinion, and gain a competitive advantage.  It encompasses a range of techniques, including propaganda, cyberattacks, deception, and manipulation, often blurring the lines between internal and external security threats.\n\nInformation Warfare is presented as a powerful tool, potentially as effective as nuclear weapons but with greater societal acceptance. It challenges traditional definitions of war by emphasizing the importance of information dominance in achieving strategic goals. \n\nThe concept has gained significant traction within Russian military strategy, where it is viewed as a key element in achieving victory and shaping the understanding of modern conflict.  Experts highlight its evolving nature, driven by advancements in technology, and emphasize the need to address its legal and ethical implications.\n\n\n\",24\n574,\"\"\"US ELECTIONS\"\"\",\"US ELECTIONS are mentioned as a target of both Russian information warfare and Russian influence. \n\",2\n144,\"\"\"RUSSIAN MILITARY DOCTRINE\"\"\",\"Russian Military Doctrine is a document that outlines Russia's approach to national security and military strategy.
