This strategy aims to influence an adversary's will and ultimately achieve strategic objectives through informational struggle. \n\nNGW is often discussed alongside the Gerasimov Doctrine and is seen as a response to Western \"\"hybrid campaigns.\"\" While initially popular, the concept of Non-Government Warfare (NGW) appears to have faded from Russian military thought.
