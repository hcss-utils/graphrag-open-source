It was a key adversary of the United States during the Cold War, engaging in a nuclear arms race with NATO. The Soviet Union held a distinct understanding of war based on Marxist-Leninist ideology, which was firmly subordinated to the Communist Party. This understanding viewed war as an inevitable tool for accelerating the global communist transformation and as the continuation of class politics by violent means.  \n\nThe Soviet Union believed that all wars stemmed from class struggle and that actions could be justified if they furthered the revolutionary process, differing from Western just war theory. They established control over half of Central Europe during World War II and were a major player in both World Wars. The Soviet Union's rise is linked to the revolutionary context. \n\nThe Soviet Union laid the theoretical and methodological foundation for Russian military theory, which persists today.  This foundation was shaped by internal and external threats and heavily influenced by Marxist-Leninist theories about war. The text describes the Soviet Union as the location where understanding of war originated from the Communist Party. It discusses the history and characteristics of military thought within the Soviet Union, its foundational policy and military doctrine, and the nature of war within the context of the Soviet Union.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a decline in Western interest in Russian military thought. \n\n\n\",27\n46,\"\"\"WAR\"\"\",\"## War: A Multifaceted Concept\n\n**War**, transliterated as 'voina' in this book, is a central concept explored throughout the text.  It is defined and analyzed from various perspectives, highlighting its complexity and multifaceted nature. \n\nWhile often understood as a conflict involving armed force, as defined by Kvachkov and Gareyev, war encompasses a broader range of activities beyond physical violence. Soviet scholars, as well as other sources, define war as \"\"the continuation of politics by means of armed force,\"\" emphasizing its strategic and political dimensions.  \n\nThe text presents diverse interpretations of war. It is discussed both as an evil to be eradicated and as a necessary tool for achieving communist goals. Additionally, it is presented as an instrument of politics, strategically employed by the Soviets. \n\nAuthors like Malyshev delve into various forms of warfare, including economic, psychological, and information warfare, expanding the traditional understanding of armed conflict.  Gorbunov and Bogdanov argue that the nature of war is constantly evolving, while Kazarin focuses on defining and analyzing its core characteristics. Clausewitz's ideas on achieving victory are discussed within the context of war, further emphasizing its strategic significance. \n\n\nUltimately, \"\"War\"\" refers to armed conflict between nations or groups, but the text delves deeper into its complexities, exploring its political, social, economic, and ideological implications.  \n\",30\n981,\"\"\"WAR THEORY\"\"\",,2\n108,\"\"\"LENIN\"\"\",\"## Lenin: A Revolutionary Redefining War\n\nLenin is a key figure in Marxist-Leninist theory, renowned for his contributions to shaping the Soviet understanding of war. He is cited as an authority on the militarization of social life under socialism and emphasized the connection between war and revolution.  Lenin viewed war as a necessary instrument for societal transformation and achieving socialism, arguing that imperialist wars are inevitable under capitalism. \n\nHe built upon the ideas of Marx and Engels, incorporating \"\"violent\"\" into the definition of war and defining it as the continuation of politics by violent means. This perspective, while influential, has been critiqued by scholars like Kirshin.  Lenin incorporated Clausewitz's ideas into Marxist theory, appreciating his use of dialectics and agreeing with his view that politics are superior to strategy. He also supported Svechin's similar stance on the primacy of politics over strategy. \n\nLenin's early writings serve as a foundational starting point for understanding Soviet military thought. His ideology emphasizes that peace is as much a continuation of politics as war, a notion further highlighted in The Soviet Military Encyclopedia.  His definition of war as an instrument of politics heavily influenced Soviet thought throughout history, even as the definition of war expanded to include non-military means. Lenin's writings on war became foundational for understanding warfare in both the Soviet Union and Russia. \n\n\n\",18\n69,\"\"\"CLAUSEWITZ\"\"\",\"## Clausewitz: A Military Theorist Whose Ideas Continue to Spark Debate\n\nClausewitz, a Prussian general and military theorist, is widely recognized for his influential ideas on war. He is best known for his dictum, \"\"war is merely a continuation of politics by other means,\"\" which suggests that war is an extension of political objectives pursued through violence. Clausewitz defined war as \"\"an act of force to compel the enemy to do your will,\"\" emphasizing the use of force to achieve desired outcomes. \n\nHis work has been both praised and criticized by subsequent military theorists. While some, like Lenin and Stalin, found his emphasis on the relationship between politics and war influential, others, such as Kirshin, Kvachkov, and Orekhov, considered his definition too narrow.  Soviet theorists, while acknowledging Clausewitz's influence, often contrasted his traditional understanding of war with their own Marxist-Leninist perspectives. \n\nClausewitz's ideas continue to be debated and analyzed today. His work is referenced in discussions about modern warfare concepts, and his views on achieving victory in war are still considered relevant by military scholars like Gorbunov and Bogdanov. Despite the passage of time, Clausewitz remains a significant figure in military history, whose theories continue to shape our understanding of war and its relationship to politics. \n\n\n\",13\n774,\"\"\"GORBUNOV AND BOGDANOV\"\"\",\"Gorbunov and Bogdanov are authors who have made significant contributions to understanding the evolving nature of warfare. They are known for their theory about war, which emphasizes the increasing importance of information warfare and argues that conventional military operations will hold little significance in future conflicts.  \n\nTheir writings, including a study on 21st-century armed confrontation and the potential of non-nuclear weapons, highlight the growing influence of nonmilitary tactics in weakening states. Notably, their work from 2009 aligns with Putin's views on the crucial role of information technology in modern conflict, suggesting their ideas have influenced prominent political figures.  \n\",7\n109,\"\"\"TROTSKY\"\"\",\"**TROTSKY** was a prominent Soviet military theorist and politician who significantly influenced early Soviet military thought. He held a deep admiration for Carl von Clausewitz, agreeing with his perspective on war as an extension of politics. Trotsky believed that the primary objective of war was to destroy the enemy's manpower through decisive blows, emphasizing the physically violent aspect of conflict.  \n\nHe is also recognized for his contributions to the concept of \"\"not peace and not war,\"\" highlighting the interconnectedness of peace and war, a notion that influenced Messner's ideas on the blurring of lines between these two states. Trotsky saw violence as the defining characteristic of war, even in light of technological advancements, a view he shared with Lenin.  \n\nWhile emphasizing the importance of physical violence, Trotsky also recognized the artistic element inherent in military strategy, contrasting this with the scientific approach advocated by some theorists like Aleksandr Svechin, whom he acknowledged as influential. \n\n\n\",6\n149,\"\"\"ARMED STRUGGLE\"\"\",\"**Armed Struggle** is defined as a form of conflict involving the use of military violence. It is characterized as organized armed conflict between states, nations, or social groups.  According to Gerasimov, it is a key feature of war, identified as both the primary content and the primary type of confrontation in wars. Armed struggle refers to a conflict involving the use of force, likely a war or rebellion. \n\",5\n84,\"\"\"KVACHKOV\"\"\",\"KVACHKOV is an author and military theorist who proposes a new conception of war, emphasizing non-military means. He presents a new classification of war that includes both military and non-military means,  differing from Clausewitz's definition while sharing similarities with Serebryannikov's views on war. \n\",5\n85,\"\"\"SEREBRYANNIKOV\"\"\",\"Serebryannikov is a military theorist and scholar whose views on war are often compared to those of Kvachkov. He emphasizes the importance of armed conflict in warfare, believing that information-psychological warfare holds significant potential for influencing citizens.  Serebryannikov's conclusions align with Kvachkov's, suggesting both scholars prioritize the role of physical violence in achieving military objectives. \n\",5\n265,\"\"\"MILITARY THEORISTS\"\"\",\"Military theorists are a group of individuals who study and analyze warfare, including its various aspects. They contribute to the understanding of war across different nations, with military theorists in Russia providing academic perspectives on war and military strategy.  These experts delve into military strategy, tactics, and doctrine, analyzing and developing theories about warfare that encompass both military and non-military dimensions. \n\",4\n305,\"\"\"MARX AND ENGELS\"\"\",\"Marx and Engels were influential thinkers whose ideas on capitalism and class struggle significantly influenced Lenin's views on war.  While they were capitalists themselves, Marx and Engels supported the British-French aggression in Crimea during the 1850s, believing it would contribute to the downfall of the czar. They viewed war as a continuation of political struggles between powers and classes, holding a perspective on war that differed from Lenin's. Despite their support for this particular conflict, Marx and Engels are also recognized as predecessors to Lenin's ideas on imperialism and war. \n\",3\n41,\"\"\"SOKOLOVSKY\"\"\",\"SOKOLOVSKY is a Soviet military theorist who authored influential works such as \"\"Voyennaya strategiya\"\" and \"\"Marksizm-leninizm o voine i armii,\"\" providing authoritative perspectives on war within the Soviet Union.  He emphasizes the principle of complete subordination of military strategy to policy, refuting claims that war had ceased to be an instrument of policy. While SOKOLOVSKY acknowledges that nuclear weapons represent a change in the character of war, he maintains that they do not fundamentally alter its nature, as opposed to those who argue for a complete shift in the definition of war.  SOKOLOVSKY holds a narrower view of war, defining it solely by armed violence. \n\",3\n90,\"\"\"SUN TZU\"\"\",\"Sun Tzu is a historical military strategist from ancient times. His ideas on warfare are widely referenced, particularly by Gorbunov and Bogdanov who cite his writings.  Serebryannikov also mentions Sun Tzu as an authority figure, highlighting his suggestion about achieving victory in war without fighting. \n\n\n\",3\n459,\"\"\"B. K. KANEVSKY\"\"\",\"B. K.
