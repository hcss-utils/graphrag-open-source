It was a key adversary of the United States during the Cold War, engaging in a nuclear arms race with NATO. The Soviet Union held a distinct understanding of war based on Marxist-Leninist ideology, which was firmly subordinated to the Communist Party. This understanding viewed war as an inevitable tool for accelerating the global communist transformation and as the continuation of class politics by violent means.  \n\nThe Soviet Union believed that all wars stemmed from class struggle and that actions could be justified if they furthered the revolutionary process, differing from Western just war theory. They established control over half of Central Europe during World War II and were a major player in both World Wars. The Soviet Union's rise is linked to the revolutionary context. \n\nThe Soviet Union laid the theoretical and methodological foundation for Russian military theory, which persists today.  This foundation was shaped by internal and external threats and heavily influenced by Marxist-Leninist theories about war. The text describes the Soviet Union as the location where understanding of war originated from the Communist Party. It discusses the history and characteristics of military thought within the Soviet Union, its foundational policy and military doctrine, and the nature of war within the context of the Soviet Union.  The dissolution of the Soviet Union led to a decline in Western interest in Russian military thought. \n\n\n\",27\n981,\"\"\"WAR THEORY\"\"\",,2\n939,\"\"\"JUST WARS\"\"\",,2\n334,\"\"\"MARXISM-LENINISM O VOINE I ARMII\"\"\",\"\"\"This book is an authoritative source on military affairs during the Soviet Union, defining war as the continuation of politics by means of armed force.\"\"\",2\n1080,\"\"\"BOLSHEVIK REGIME\"\"\",\"The Bolshevik Regime was a fledgling government that faced both internal struggles and foreign interventions, making its existence precarious.  \n\",1\n20,\"\"\"BRUNTALSKY & MALTSEV\"\"\",,1\n982,\"\"\"CHAPTER 2\"\"\",\"\"\"Chapter 2 focuses on the development of post-Soviet Russian military theory.\"\"\",1\n587,\"\"\"COMMUNIST PARTY\"\"\",\"The **Communist Party** held significant influence over the Soviet Union's understanding of war.
