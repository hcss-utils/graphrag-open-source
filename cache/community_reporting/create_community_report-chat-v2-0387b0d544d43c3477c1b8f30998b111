It defines and addresses hybrid warfare threats, having adopted this concept to understand contemporary Russian warfare tactics. NATO employs a flexible response strategy involving both conventional and nuclear means. \n\nNATO's expansion has been perceived as a threat by Russia, leading to increased tensions between the two entities. The alliance is viewed by Russia as a major challenge in its military doctrine and a potential adversary in future conflicts.
