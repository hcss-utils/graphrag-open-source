He held a deep admiration for Carl von Clausewitz, agreeing with his perspective on war as an extension of politics. Trotsky believed that the primary objective of war was to destroy the enemy's manpower through decisive blows, emphasizing the physically violent aspect of conflict.  \n\nHe is also recognized for his contributions to the concept of \"\"not peace and not war,\"\" highlighting the interconnectedness of peace and war, a notion that influenced Messner's ideas on the blurring of lines between these two states. Trotsky saw violence as the defining characteristic of war, even in light of technological advancements, a view he shared with Lenin.  \n\nWhile emphasizing the importance of physical violence, Trotsky also recognized the artistic element inherent in military strategy, contrasting this with the scientific approach advocated by some theorists like Aleksandr Svechin, whom he acknowledged as influential. \n\n\n\",6\n681,\"\"\"SOVIET MILITARY THEORY\"\"\",\"Soviet military theory is a set of ideas and doctrines about warfare developed by the Soviet Union.

He stressed the crucial role of military history in understanding strategy, advocating for a deep understanding of past conflicts to inform present-day military planning.
