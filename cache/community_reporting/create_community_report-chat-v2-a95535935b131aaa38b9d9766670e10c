He is recognized for his contributions to the understanding of war's evolution, particularly in light of modern non-military means of confrontation.  \n\nGareyev argues for a traditional definition of war while acknowledging the increasing importance of non-military forms of struggle, such as information warfare and \"\"soft power,\"\" which he views as threats to Russia. He emphasizes the need to reevaluate the definition of war in the 21st century due to these evolving threats.  \n\nHis book, \"\"Battles on the Military-Historical Front,\"\" endorsed by General Gerasimov, reflects Russia's perspective on information warfare. Gareyev has also written extensively about the changing nature of war, including the blurring of lines between military and non-military means, and the significance of moral superiority, technology, and doctrine in modern warfare. He is considered a leading figure in Russian military thought, comparable to Kartapolov and Gerasimov. \n\n\n\",30\n346,\"\"\"ACADEMY OF MILITARY SCIENCES\"\"\",\"The **Academy of Military Sciences** is a Russian institution that plays a significant role in defining the nature and essence of war.
