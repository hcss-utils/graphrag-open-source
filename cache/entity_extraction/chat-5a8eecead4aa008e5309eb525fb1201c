Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

Thus, it did not fully reflect the New Look reforms, which began in earnest in 2009, following the Russo-Georgian War in August 2008.\nIn the 2013 Foreign Policy Concept of the Russian Federation, the main strands of thought remained from the Foreign Policy Concept of 2008, such as the view of NATO, Russia's role as a great power, regional priorities, and the importance of the UN Security Council as the main locus for ensuring international security. However, the 2013 concept was more explicit on security policy and the understanding of war. Under the heading \"Foreign Policy of the Russian Federation in the Modern World, \" the concept argued that \"efforts to build up or modernize offensive potentials, to create and deploy new types of weapons erode the global security architecture\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2013, point II.7). The concept saw that \"economic, legal, scientific, environmental, demographic and IT factors become as important for states in influencing the world politics as the military power\" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2013, point II.10).\nThe concept stated that \"some concepts that are being implemented are aimed at overthrowing legitimate authorities in sovereign states under the pretext of protecting the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
