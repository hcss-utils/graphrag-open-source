In this way, Chekinov and Bogdanov go far in arguing the importance of nonmilitary means over military ones. In analyzing their work, Thomas argued that they were drawing heavily on Slipchenko and that he was likely the most important source behind their thinking (Thomas 2016a, 555) . It is notable that Chekinov and Bogdanov suggested that the Arab Spring was a sign of a new age of war. They also relied on the two-step approach to war, whereby the first and major effort was via nonmilitary means, and, should they fail, the second would be military means, in line with their earlier article from 2011.\nThe perception and importance of engineered and controlled revolutions by the West, and particularly the United States, was also expressed by President Putin in his speech following the annexation of Crimea. He stated that the events in Ukraine mirrored what has been happening in the world the past decades with \"controlled 'color' revolutions\" (Putin 2014a ). Putin stated that he sympathized with those who came out on Maidan to protest corruption and poverty but that \"those who stood behind the latest events in Ukraine had a different agenda: they were preparing yet another government takeover; they wanted to seize power and would stop short of nothing. They resorted to terror, murder and riots\" (Putin 2014a) .\nAnother interesting contribution came from Maj. Gen.
