Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Furthermore, the sanctions that the United States and the EU imposed on Russia beginning in 2014 were understood by the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, as an attempt to create \"regime change\" in Russia (Reuters 2014) and by the head of Russia's second-largest bank as amounting to \"economic war\" (TASS 2015) . Likewise, Putin claimed that the fall of oil prices in 2014 was created by the United States and Saudi Arabia to sink the Russian economy (TASS 2014) .\nIf the Russian government believes itself to be in a war with the West, albeit one conducted via nonmilitary means, this explains why a high degree of risktaking with military and nonmilitary means is warranted. Furthermore, when Western states are taking actions that they perceive as being short of warsanctions, democracy promotion, and information operations-but that are understood by Russia as amounting to war, there is a risk of unconscious and/ or unintentional escalation. As the cost of such can be vast, grasping Russia's understanding of war is thus crucial for international and regional security and is something this book seeks to provide.\nHas the Russian understanding of the nature of war changed? Answering this question is the primary goal of this book.
