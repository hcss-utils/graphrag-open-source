She not only endured much without complaint, but also encouraged me to delve more deeply into the subject, so I could become more knowledgeable about the subject. Without her support, I could not have finished the work. I owe much of my accomplishment to her. I am also deeply thankful for my MMAS thesis committee, Mr. Joseph Donalbain, Dr. John Modinger, and LTC Michael Thorpe, for their consistent advice on the structure, logic, and direction of the thesis. They never hesitated to take significant portions of their time to discuss the thesis. I also would like to recognize the Art of War scholars, who, under the guidance of Dr. Dean Nowowiejski, the Ike Skelton Chair of the Command and General Staff College (CGSC), provided me with many insights on how the thesis could be better structured and revised. In 2006, Israel launched an attack into Lebanese territory. This event, later known as the Second Lebanon War, was in response to a few hostile actions executed by Hezbollah, including rocket fires into Israeli territory and the abduction of two Israeli soldiers. To counter the Israeli forces, Hezbollah used hybrid warfare, incorporating both conventional tactics, such as taking defensive positions with ground forces, and\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
