Bartles thus argues, although not explicitly, that these nonmilitary means are changing the Russian military's understanding of war away from something strictly defined by armed violence. For all its merits, Bartles's study is only eight pages long and does not delve into the questions of how theorists other than Gerasimov discussed the issue, how and when the understanding of nonmilitary means has changed, and why these means came to be seen as useful.\nBartles argued in a subsequent article that the 2014 Military Doctrine and Gerasimov's 2013 article showed an acceptance of the view that color revolutions and Arab Spring-type events were the largest threats to the Russian government, as opposed to military invasions (Bartles 2016b, 9) . These were understood among Russian military theorists as the mastery of new forms and methods of warfare by the West (Bartles 2016b, 4) . This led to the fact that \"the primacy of effort has now shifted from military to nonmilitary methods, by a factor of 4:1. This is indeed a new development in Russian military thinking\" (Bartles 2016b, 4) . This reasoning emphasized the notion that beyond nonmilitary means always being important, they are now placed at the center of the military's understanding of, and priorities in, contemporary war. Out of these, Bartles identified information means and NGOs (\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
