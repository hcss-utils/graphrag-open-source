Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

In Popov's eyes, this new type of war \"goes beyond the traditional idea about war, acquiring a combined character, turning into an intricate tangle of political intrigues, a fierce struggle for resources and financial flows, irreconcilable civilizational clashes\" (Popov 2013) . Thus, the primary goal of the armed forces was \"not the physical destruction of the enemy's armed forces, but demoralization and the imposition of their will on the entire population of the state\" (Popov 2013 ). Thus, Popov both highlights the threat from color revolutions and internal unrest while simultaneously seeing these as precursors to violence and civil war.\nIn a study on the essence and content of modern war, retired major general and professor Yuri Kirshin stated that there is no common understanding of the nature and content of war, neither in Russia nor in the rest of the world (Kirshin 2013) . He went on to criticize the definition of war stemming from Lenin, who defined war as the continuation of politics by violent means (Kirshin 2013) . Rather, Kirshin argued that \"such an understanding of war does not allow an adequate response to contemporary global challenges and threats\" (Kirshin 2013) . He then criticized Clausewitz for defining war only as a continuation of foreign policy and so narrowly that it excluded the nonmilitary forms of\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
