As a result, Russian experts among themselves, and their Western colleagues, often mean different things when using the same terms and use different terms to refer to the same things. Additional factors hamper this lack of codification even further. First, there is a linguistic issue. The Russian professional discourse uses the terms coercion, deterrence and compellence interchangeably. The Russian equivalent of the Western term deterrencesderzhivanierefers to the efforts to preserve the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more reactive modus operandi. The term compellenceprinuzhdenierefers to the efforts to change the status quo and implies, similarly to the Western usage, a more proactive connotation. There is no established term for coercion, as an umbrella term for both deterrence and compellence. The Russian discourse often utilises the term deterrence but rarely the term compellence to express a concept similar to the Western term coercion. The context usually indicates which of the forms of influence authors are referring to. Second, the terminological discrepancy has perceptual underpinnings. Western experts often dub the current Russian approach 'hybrid warfare' (HW), implying that Moscow incorporates nonmilitary, information, cyber, and nuclear, conventional and sub-conventional tools of influence in an orchestrated campaign. Russian experts, however, never utilise this term to describe their own approach.
