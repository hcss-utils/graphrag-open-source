Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Similarly, Galeotti also emphasized the perceived cultural offensive from the West (Galeotti 2016b, 287) . This was indeed a part of \"a culture of 'total war' [that] still informs doctrinal thinking\" (Galeotti 2016b, 297) . This notion is helpful to understand the emphasis on political, economic, and information arenas that were included in the understanding of war. The 2014 doctrine \"stands out for emphasizing domestic threats to national security\" (Sinovets and Renz 2015, 74) . It represented \"the Kremlin's anxiety over social stability, expressed in the explicit fear of subversive activities conducted by the intelligence services of Western states aimed at provoking social unrest in Russia\" (Sinovets and Renz 2015, 75) .\nDefense Minister Shoigu argued in the run-up to the 2014 doctrine that color revolutions were taking on a new meaning as a tool for external influence after the unrest in Ukraine (RIA Novosti 2014b). In the same article, Shoigu continued that \"the US and EU have provoked the removal from power of the legitimate president of the country\" (RIA Novosti 2014b\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
