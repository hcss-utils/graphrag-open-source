Russian military analysts developed an appreciation for the vulnerability of critical infrastructure to nonnuclear attacks in the first decade of the 2000s. For example, a 2006 Russian Academy of Sciences study argued that \"conducting large-scale military conflicts with conventional and/or mass use of nuclear weapons is becoming pointless because the consequences of destroying infrastructure nodes (even singular) could lead to unexpected consequences.\" As examples, the study discussed the potential implications of damaging critical infrastructure such as nuclear power plants or hydroelectric plants. 184 In 2009, Russian military analysts described research that showed the importance of finding key nodes (or, as others have called them, \"narrow spaces\" or \"keystones\" of key systems) of elements of the opponent's industrial systems that could serve as targets for conventional precision strike. These \"strategic\" targets are not to be confused with operational-level targets as determined by Russian general purpose forces in combat, which are warfighting determinations. At the tactical-operational level, the importance of a target is determined by its relevance to combat operations and the perceived threat derived from it, which is context based. In this sense, experts define a \"critically important object\" as one that will make combat operations, particularly offensives, difficult to sustain. 190 Consideration is also based on the extent to which their destruction degrades offensive potential, firepower, and the efficacy of the opponent's kill chain. 191 From\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
