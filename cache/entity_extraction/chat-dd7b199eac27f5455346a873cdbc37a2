Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

When the 2007-8 elections passed without major criticism and after the \"reset\" between Russia and the United States in 2009, the threat subsided momentarily on the Russian agenda. This came to change with the Arab Spring and the protests during the elections in Russia 2011-12. After this, the threat of color revolutions took a central role in the threat perception of the political elites and was directly attributed to Western governments. The epitome of this threat came with the Euromaidan revolution in 2013-14, which the Russian leadership saw as a success for Western color revolutions against a critical ally of Russia.\nThe Rose Revolution in Georgia was not met by strong protests from the Russian government, and it helped to mediate President Eduard Shevardnadze leaving office in 2003. After the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Russian government's criticism of the West grew stronger. On December 23, 2004three days before the rerun of the second round of voting in the Ukrainian presidential elections, in which Viktor Yushchenko was elected president-Putin held his end-of-year press conference. In it, he criticized the double standards of the United States and the EU in propagating democracy and human rights but not supporting the Serbs in Kosovo\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
