How does it diverge from previous Russian practice? The main novelty is that in essence, this approach is not a brute force but a coercion strategy. In contrast to traditional massive use of force, cross-domain coercion aims at manipulating the adversary's perception, decision-making and behaviour. This notion lies at the heart of NGW, which orchestrates the military and non-military measures while minimising kinetic engagements. Since Russian usage of the term 'deterrence' equally refers to the prevention of the threat from materialising, to deterrence in peacetime and to the use of force in crisis and in wartime, it strongly resonates with the concept of intra-war coercion aimed at shaping the battlefield dynamic. The quest to shape the strategic environment, whether in an active or reactive mode, is a departure from the big war paradigm that dominated Russian military thought for decades. This is not to say that Moscow has stopped massive operations maximising violence, but the choice to address threats mainly by coercively shaping the environment across domains to evaporate them is somewhat novel for the Russian military.\nSince NGW is less about traditional military destruction but rather targets the adversary's perception to affect its will and choices, the role of the informational domain looms unprecedentedly large. Its addition to the traditional domains 54 is a second novelty. Informational strike epitomises the logic Gerasimov's doctrine being a strategy of breaking up the internal coherence of the enemy system\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
