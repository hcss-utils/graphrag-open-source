This is a potential contradiction, which he did not address explicitly. Slipchenko's work was still, long after his death, influential in the study of the future of war in Russia (Popov n.d.) .\nEven in the early days of post-Soviet Russia, there was an uneasiness about the potential impact of technological innovation on the conduct of war. This fear was arguably heightened by the technological lag between Russia and more advanced countries. During a roundtable discussion in 1994, Maj. Gen. Ivan Vorobyov, Maj. Gen. Vladimir Belous, and Maj. Gen. Slipchenko warned that \"future war will employ 'fundamentally new types of weapons' to include: geophysical, electro-magnetic or radio frequency, infrasonic, genetic, ethnic, psychotronic, beam, laser, and non-lethal weapons\" (Grau and Thomas 1996,\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
