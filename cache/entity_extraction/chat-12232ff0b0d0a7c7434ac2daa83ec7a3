Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2.

Thus, the invasion of Finland in 1939, the deployment of nuclear missiles to Cuba that led to the crisis of 1962, the intervention in Czechoslovakia in 1968, and the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979 were all considered defensive actions by Soviet military theorists and leaders (Scott and Scott 1988, 258) . This is not to argue that the Soviet ethics of justifying their own wars as legitimate in all circumstances is unique but rather to illustrate how the ethics of war are reflected in Soviet ideology. In these cases presented above, the sociopolitical constitution rather than particular actions allow war to be perceived as offensive or defensive, just or unjust.\nWhile they were not part of Soviet military thought, it is worth surveying the ideas of Evgeny Messner (1891 Messner ( -1974)) . Messner was an officer in the Imperial Russian Army and later fought for the Whites during the civil war (Domnin 2005, 22-23) . He was a staunch anticommunist, and his works were prohibited in the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, his thoughts were revived in Russian military thought in the 1990s and 2000s and are particularly evocative of many modern views of war\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
