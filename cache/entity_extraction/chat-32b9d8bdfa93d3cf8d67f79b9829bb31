Several years prior to the 2014 doctrine, the GS's research on an indirect approach in warfare recommended increasing 'asymmetrical measures'. 39 GS officers argued that the sophistication of weaponry and the catastrophic consequences incline actors to non-military means. Whereas in the past, the 'brute force' dominated military affairs and the 'indirect approach' had a secondary role, the situation now is reversed. The employment of asymmetrical means enables to damage a 'stronger' adversary, and even impose political will, without a decisive battlefield victory. Success results from the skilful orchestration of military and non-military (political, psychological, ideological and informational) efforts. According to the authors, today, the ability to master an 'indirect approach' manifests the excellence of military art; its culmination is the employment of a variety of means, primarily informational dominance, to neutralise the enemy without the use of force, to prevent military confrontation altogether or to mitigate its consequences. The 'asymmetrical approach' employs 'a complex of means unequal to those of the adversary' and may include causing apprehension with regard to the adversary's intentions and responses; demonstration of resolve and capabilities to repulse the invasion with unacceptable consequences; military actions aimed at deterring the potential aggressor by assured destruction of its vulnerable and strategically important objects and persuasion that aggression is doomed to failure. 40 Outlining the coercion\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
