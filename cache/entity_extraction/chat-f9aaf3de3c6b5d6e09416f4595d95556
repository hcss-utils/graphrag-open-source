After the Orange Revolution in Ukraine, the Russian government's criticism of the West grew stronger. On December 23, 2004three days before the rerun of the second round of voting in the Ukrainian presidential elections, in which Viktor Yushchenko was elected president-Putin held his end-of-year press conference. In it, he criticized the double standards of the United States and the EU in propagating democracy and human rights but not supporting the Serbs in Kosovo, the Albanians in Macedonia, or the ethnic Russians in Latvia (Putin 2004 ). Putin criticized the promotion of democracy by the US and EU as selective and instrumental, but he did not accuse them of creating the revolution. However, he stated that \"the most dangerous [thing] . . . is the creation of a system of permanent revolutions\" (Putin 2004) .\nThree weeks later, on January 13, 2005, Russian defense minister Sergei Ivanov also criticized the West for double standards in its Ukrainian policy.\nIn his view, the Western nations had stated that they would acknowledge the election only if \"their\" candidate won. Ivanov felt that \"in regard to a sovereign state . . . [such statements] are fraught with the most grave consequences. The entire history demonstrates that democracy cannot be imposed upon from the outside\" (Ivanov 2005) . He also stated that the importance of the CIS states to Russia is \"why we react and will\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
