Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:\n- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized\n- entity_type: One of the following types: [organization,person,geo,event]\n- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities\nFormat each entity as (\"entity\"<|><entity_name><|><entity_type><|><entity_description>\n\n2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.\nFor each pair of related entities, extract the following information:\n- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1\n- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1\n- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other\n- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity\n Format each relationship as (\"relationship\"<|><source_entity><|><target_entity><|><relationship_description><|><relationship_strength>)\n\n3.

Thus, even if physically violent means could be used, the defining factor of the war was the impact on national psychology and values. This is in line with Vladimirov and Burenok, who saw that the most refined form of information warfare was the manipulation of mass consciousness by the West in Ukraine. In particular, Vladimirov was relying on Messner's thought. This school could also be seen to have gained some recognition in the statement from the 2013 Foreign Policy Concept that war is an ongoing global competition on a civilizational level.\nThe second subcategory, subversion-wars (myatezhvoina), was in part related to the first, which sees as leading activities the use of terrorism, illegal armed groups, information, and psychological means of influence (Konyzhev and Sergunin 2014, 88) . The Military Encyclopedic Dictionary defined myatezhvoina as armed fighting by insurgent or rebel forces (Ministry of Defense 2007).
