As such, the journal (especially articles by the GS Military-Strategic Analysis Center) reflects the intellectual climate, main questions and debates at the heart of Russian strategic theory and policy. Even though this discourse is meant for internal consumption, it is often difficult to determine its credibility. Official periodicals may have more credibility than unofficial sources, but the latter often offer useful insights. Some authors have more credibility than others. To overcome the limitations inherent in open sources research, this article bases each assertion on several unrelated materials, by experts within and outside the government and featuring in different publications.\nThe article proceeds in three sections. The first section describes the notions of 'Nuclear Deterrence' and 'NGW' as the conceptual pretext and context out of which the current thinking evolved. The second highlights the emergence of conventional and informational (cyber) deterrence theories and describes their merging with the earlier, nuclear deterrence concept into the current 'cross-domain coercion' construct. The third draws on cultural explanations to examine the innovativeness of the Russian concept. The conclusion offers theoretical and practical insights.\nThe current Russian variation on the theme of cross-domain coercion can be grasped only within its conceptual pretext and context.
