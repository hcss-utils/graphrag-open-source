That is, perceived stability at higher thresholds of conflict may result in instability at lower levels because of the perceived ability, by at least one party, that it can manage escalation.\nBy developing an interlinked series of approaches that range from intimidation to inflicting calibrated damage for the purpose of escalation management, the Russian military has not traded warfighting for intra-war deterrence. The means involved, and the operational concepts for their employment, afford a suitable hedge strategy to be used in theater warfighting with precision conventional or nonstrategic nuclear weapons. Therefore, there is both a general purpose force for warfighting, and the ability to employ a pre-designated strategic deterrence force to deliver deterrent damage. These capabilities are equally applicable in peacetime, during which they perform demonstrative actions intended to contain the United States and induce restraint in Russian adversaries.\nThe US lags in developing such concepts; it focuses on warfighting capabilities while a tremendous cognitive gap remains on the question of escalation management and war termination. The absence of a theory of escalation management or approaches that could affect war termination, remains a significant deficit in strategy for great power war. Warfighting by itself is an inadequate hedge strategy should deterrence fail, when envisioning that such a war would be fought against a peer nuclear adversary. It fails to account for the challenge of controlled escalation stratagems employed by adversaries, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
