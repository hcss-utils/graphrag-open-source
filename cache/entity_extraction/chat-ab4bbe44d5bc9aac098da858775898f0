He stated that war has been \"understood as the continuation of politics by means of armed violence\" and that this was how war is interpreted in the law On Defense (Gareyev 2017 ). However, Gareyev saw that \"now, when the scope and technological opportunities of nonmilitary means of confrontation have significantly expanded, it is increasingly being asked whether their use means aggression\" (Gareyev 2017) . Therefore, Gareyev argued that wartime laws, or their interpretation, needed to be changed (Gareyev 2017) .\nGareyev saw that scholars in the Russian debate had started to divide the definition of war into the traditional one-the use of armed violence (nasiliya)and the nontraditional one, which involved nonmilitary means (Gareyev 2017 ; see also Gareyev 2018) . Therefore, Gareyev called for a clarification of the definition of the essence of war, which should be done together by the Academy of Military Sciences and the Foreign Ministry, whose results were to be sent to the UN (Gareyev 2017) . Gareyev saw that the reasons for these military threats was that nuclear weapons had become an impediment for large-scale war and that, \"therefore, the\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
