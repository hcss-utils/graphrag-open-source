Second, asymmetrical and indirect actions of a political, economic, informational and technological nature neutralise the adversary's military superiority. 'Indirect strategy' is primarily about using the informational struggle to neutralise the adversary without, or with minimal, employment of force. Third, the complex of nonmilitary actions downgrades the abilities of the adversary to compel or to employ force and produces a negative public image that eventually dissuades the adversary from initiating\n######################\nOutput:", "parameters": {"model": "gemma2", "temperature": 0.0, "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0, "max_tokens": 4000, "n": null}}
